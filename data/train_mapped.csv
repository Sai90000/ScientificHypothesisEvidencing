The present study explored the relationship between SD, PSU, and mental health problems using the newly developed Smartphone distraction Scale (SDS). A total of three hundred and twenty smartphone users (Mage = 20.30, SD = 1.67) completed a questionnaire that comprised psychometric scales for the aforementioned variables. Results showed that SD was significantly correlated with PSU, anxiety, depression and stress. PSU fully mediated the relationships from SD to anxiety and depression. PSU partially mediated the relationship between SD and stress. The four-factor SDS was reliable and obtained good model fit in confirmatory factor analysis. This study suggests that being distracted by smartphone use can be associated with mental health issues while the level of PSU might be the bridge of this link. The present study is one of very few studies to examine SD in China, which aimed to investigate the relationships between SD, PSU and mental health issues (stress, anxiety and depression), and adopt the newly developed SDS in the Chinese context. Further studies are needed to explore the complex mechanism between SD and mental health.",Social Media and Mental Health

We aimed to examine the incidence rates of these psychopathologies among young people in the UK in the 2 years following onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a population-based study using the primary care electronic health records of patients aged 10 to 24 years in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The observation period was from Jan 1, 2010, to March 31, 2022. We calculated the monthly incidence rates of eating disorders and self-harm according to the first record of each outcome. On the basis of antecedent trends between January, 2010, and February, 2020, negative binomial regression models were fitted to predict monthly incidence rates after the pandemic began in March, 2020. Percentage differences between observed and expected incidence were calculated to indicate changes since the onset of the pandemic, with stratification by sex, age, and deprivation quintile. Findings The primary care health records of 9 184 712 patients aged 10 to 24 years (4 836 226 [52.7%] female patients and 4 348 486 [47.3%] male patients; n=1881 general practices) were included for analysis. The incidence rates of eating disorders and self-harm among girls were higher than expected between March 1, 2020, and March 31, 2022. The observed incidence of eating disorders was 42.4% (95% CI 257613) higher than expected for girls aged 13 to 16 years, and 32�0% (13�3�53�8) higher than expected for girls aged 17�19 years, whereas other age groups showed little difference between observed and expected incidence. Similarly, the increase in self-harm incidence was driven by girls aged 13�16 years, for whom the observed incidence was 38�4% (20�7�58�5) higher than expected. By contrast, among boys in all age groups, the incidence rates of eating disorders and self-harm were lower than, or close to, the expected rates. Among boys, the observed incidence of eating disorders was 22�8% (9�2�34�4) lower than expected, and the observed incidence of self-harm was 11.5% lower than expected. The estimated increases in eating disorder and self-harm incidence among girls aged 13 to 16 years were largely attributable to increases within less deprived communities.",Adolescent mood disorders since 2010

We found a weak, over-time relationship between misinformation and media skepticism. Specifically, initial beliefs on factually dubious information were negatively correlated with subsequent levels of trust in the news media. Lower trust in the media, in turn, was related over time to higher levels of misinformation. However, we found no evidence of a reverse, parallel process where media trust shielded users against misinformation, further reinforcing trust in the news media. The lack of evidence of a downward spiral suggests that the corrosive effects of misinformation on attitudes toward the news media are less serious than originally suggested.

With other Wall Street institutions on the brink of insolvency, the financial system slid towards a free fall. Governments around the world responded with more than $11 trillion in emergency bailouts. Financial institutions deemed too-big-to-fail were rescued in the hopes of escaping an economic abyss. In the aftermath of the collapse, Congress acted to address dangerous risks and externalities in the financial sector. With the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress codified the logic of systemic importance in financial regulation. In essence, if an institution is consequential enough to pose systemic risks to the entire economy, that institution should receive heightened regulatory scrutiny. A distinct but parallel set of questions now exists about certain digital platforms. A small number of companies some governed by dual-class share structures have immense power over social behavior, human health, and the information ecosystem. Yet, despite the enormous externalities generated by their business models, digital platforms remain virtually unregulated. Our paper addresses two primary questions: First, have some digital platforms attained systemically important status? And, if so, does their systemic importance warrant enhanced regulatory oversight? In addressing those questions, we consider parallels with financial regulation, drawing lessons from the framework for systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) in the Dodd-Frank era.",Social Media and Political Dysfunction

We included data from 9,133,246 individuals aged 120 who contributed 117,682,651 person-years of observation time. Sex- and age-stratified annual incidence rates were estimated for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (age groups: 15, 69, 1012, 1316, 1719), depression, anxiety disorders (69, 1012, 1316, 1719), eating disorders and self-harm (1012, 1316, 1719) during 20032018. We fitted negative binomial regressions to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) to examine change in incidence between the first (2003) and final year (2018) year of observation and to examine sex-specific incidence.ResultsThe results indicated that the overall incidence has increased substantially in both boys and girls in between 2003 and 2018 for anxiety disorders (IRR 3.51 95% CI 3.183.89), depression (2.37; 2.032.77), ASD (2.36; 1.723.26), ADHD (2.3; 1.733.25), and self-harm (2.25; 1.822.79). The incidence for eating disorders also increased (IRR 1.3 95% CI 1.061.61), but less sharply. The incidence of anxiety disorders, depression, self-harm and eating disorders was in absolute terms higher in girls, whereas the opposite was true for the incidence of ADHD and ASD, which were higher among boys. The largest relative increases in incidence were observed for neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly among girls diagnosed with ADHD or ASD. However, in absolute terms, the incidence was much higher for depression and anxiety disorders.ConclusionThe number of young people seeking help for psychological distress appears to have increased in recent years. Changes to diagnostic criteria, reduced stigma, and increased awareness may partly explain our results, but we cannot rule out true increases in incidence occurring in the population. Whatever the explanation, the marked rise in demand for healthcare services means that it may be more challenging for affected young people to promptly access the care and support that they need.",Adolescent mood disorders since 2010

We tested whether men tend more to provide likes to messages posted by populist parties, messages published by radical populists, messages containing populist contents, and different components of populist messages. Findings confirm the existence of a gender-oriented reaction to populism: Men tend to support populist actors and parties on Facebook more than women do, by providing likes to their content. Yet the difference in gender gap between radical and moderate parties is not significant. We also found that the antielite component of populist discourse obtains more likes by male Facebook users.

We explore this point by probing the moral contagion phenomenon, whereby the use of moral-emotional language increases the probability of message spread. Through out-of-sample prediction, model comparisons and specification curve analyses, we find that the moral contagion model performs no better than an implausible XYZ contagion model.

In addition, users conform their outrage expressions to the expressive norms of their social networks, suggesting norm learning also guides online outrage expressions. Norm learning overshadows reinforcement learning when normative information is readily observable: in ideologically extreme networks, where outrage expression is more common, users are less sensitive to social feedback when deciding whether to express outrage.

Adolescents who used pornography more frequently were male, at a more advanced pubertal stage, sensation seekers, and had weak or troubled family relations. Pornography use was associated with more permissive sexual attitudes and tended to be linked with stronger gender-stereotypical sexual beliefs. It also seemed to be related to the occurrence of sexual intercourse, greater experience with casual sex behavior, and more sexual aggression, both in terms of perpetration and victimization.

We conducted a study of freshman Twitter-using students (N=197) over their first quarter of college, between October and December of 2015. We collected students tweets, labeled the content of the tweets according to different emotional states, and gave theme weekly surveys on sleep quality. Tweeting more frequently on weekday late nights was associated with lower sleep quality (=0.937, SE=0.352); tweeting more frequently on weekday evenings was associated with better quality sleep (=0.189, SE=0.097). Tweets during the weekday that were labeled related to the emotion of fear were associated with lower sleep quality (=0.302, SE=0.131). Results suggest that social media use is associated with sleep quality among students. Results provided can be used to inform future interventions to improve sleep quality among college students.",Social Media and Mental Health

This is the first large-scale investigation of climate anxiety in children and young people globally and its relationship with perceived government response. Methods We surveyed 10 000 children and young people (aged 16 to 25 years) in ten countries (Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria, Philippines, Portugal, the UK, and the USA; 1000 participants per country). Invitations to complete the survey were sent via the platform Kantar between May 18 and June 7, 2021. Data were collected on participants thoughts and feelings about climate change, and government responses to climate change. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each aspect of climate anxiety, and Pearson's correlation analysis was done to evaluate whether climate-related distress, functioning, and negative beliefs about climate change were linked to thoughts and feelings about government response. Findings Respondents across all countries were worried about climate change (59% were very or extremely worried and 84% were at least moderately worried). More than 50% reported each of the following emotions: sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless, and guilty. More than 45% of respondents said their feelings about climate change negatively affected their daily life and functioning, and many reported a high number of negative thoughts about climate change (eg, 75% said that they think the future is frightening and 83% said that they think people have failed to take care of the planet). Respondents rated governmental responses to climate change negatively and reported greater feelings of betrayal than of reassurance. Climate anxiety and distress were correlated with perceived inadequate government response and associated feelings of betrayal. Interpretation Climate anxiety and dissatisfaction with government responses are widespread in children and young people in countries across the world and impact their daily functioning. A perceived failure by governments to respond to the climate crisis is associated with increased distress. There is an urgent need for further research into the emotional impact of climate change on children and young people and for governments to validate their distress by taking urgent action on climate change.",Alternative Hypotheses to the Adolescent Mental Illness Crisis A Collaborative Review

We explored associations between the frequency of social media use and later mental health and wellbeing in adolescents, and how these effects might be mediated. Methods We did secondary analyses of publicly available data from the Our Futures study, a nationally representative, longitudinal study of 12 866 young people from age 13 years to 16 years in England. The exposure considered was the frequency of social media use (from weekly or less to very frequent [multiple times daily]) at wave 1 (participants aged 13 to 14 years) through wave 3 of the study (participants aged 1516 years). Outcomes were mental health at wave 2 (with high 12-item General Health Questionnaire [GHQ12] scores [?3] indicating psychological distress), and wellbeing at wave 3 (life satisfaction, feeling life is worthwhile, happiness, and anxiety, rated from 1 to 10 by participants). Analyses were adjusted for a minimal sufficient confounding structure, and were done separately for boys and girls. Cyberbullying, sleep adequacy, and physical activity were assessed as potential mediators of the effects. Findings Very frequent use of social media increased from wave 1 to wave 3: from 34.4% (95% CI 32.4 to 36.4) to 61.9% (60.3 to 63.6) in boys, and 51.4% (49.5 to 53.3) to 75.4% (73.8 to 76.9) in girls. Very frequent social media use in wave 1 predicted a high GHQ12 score at wave 2 among girls (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.31 [95% CI 1.06 to 1.63], p=0.014; N=4429) and boys (1.67 [1.24to 2.26], p=0.0009; N=4379). Persistent very frequent social media use across waves 1 and 2 predicted lower wellbeing among girls only (adjusted ORs 0.86 [0.74 to 0.99], N=3753, p=0.039 for life satisfaction; 0·80 [0·700·92], N=3831, p=0·0013 for happiness; 1·28 [1·111·48], N=3745, p=0·0007 for anxiety). Adjustment for cyberbullying, sleep, and physical activity attenuated the associations of social media use with GHQ12 high score (proportion mediated 58·2%), life satisfaction (80·1%), happiness (47·7%), and anxiety (32·4%) in girls, such that these associations (except for anxiety) were no longer significant; however, the association with GHQ12 high score among boys remained significant, being mediated only 12·1% by these factors. Interpretation Mental health harms related to very frequent social media use in girls might be due to a combination of exposure to cyberbullying or displacement of sleep or physical activity, whereas other mechanisms appear to be operative in boys. Interventions to promote mental health should include efforts to prevent or increase resilience to cyberbullying and ensure adequate sleep and physical activity in young people.",Social Media and Mental Health

The public religiosity variable combines two items measuring frequency of attendance at religious services and frequency of participation in religious youth group activities. The private religiosity variable combines two items measuring frequency of prayer and importance of religion. Our results support previous evidence that religiosity is protective for a number of adolescent health-related outcomes. In general, both public and private religiosity was protective against cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana use. On closer examination it appeared that private religiosity was more protective against experimental substance use, while public religiosity had a larger association with regular use, and in particular with regular cigarette use. Both public and private religiosity was associated with a lower probability of having ever had sexual intercourse. Only public religiosity had a significant effect on effective birth control at first sexual intercourse and, for females, for having ever been pregnant. However, neither dimension of religiosity was associated with birth control use at first or most recent sex. Public religiosity was associated with lower emotional distress while private religiosity was not. Only private religiosity was significantly associated with a lower probability of having had suicidal thoughts or having attempted suicide. Both public and private religiosity was associated with a lower probability of having engaged in violence in the last year. Our results suggest that further work is warranted to explore the causal mechanisms by which religiosity is protective for adolescents. Needed is both theoretical work that identifies mechanisms that could explain the different patterns of empirical results and surveys that collect data specific to the hypothesized mechanisms.

Evidence from Longitudinal Data,"Previous research suggests that pornography use, under certain circumstances, may negatively influence the quality of romantic relationships. Yet we still know relatively little about whether watching pornography is associated with the stability of romantic relationships later on. This study examined whether Americans who use pornography, either at all or more frequently, are more prone to report experiencing a romantic breakup over time. Longitudinal data were taken from the 2006 and 2012 waves of the nationally representative Portraits of American Life Study (N = 969). Binary logistic regression analyses demonstrated that Americans who viewed pornography at all in 2006 were nearly twice as likely as those who never viewed pornography to report experiencing a romantic breakup by 2012, even after controlling for relevant factors such as 2006 relationship status and other sociodemographic correlates. This association was considerably stronger for men than for women and for unmarried Americans than for married Americans. Analyses also showed a linear relationship between how frequently Americans viewed pornography in 2006 and their odds of experiencing a breakup by 2012. The findings affirm that earlier pornography use is associated with lower stability within Americans romantic relationships, especially for men and the unmarried.

Binomial logistic regressions investigated associations between daily social media use and each sleep parameter, controlling for a range of relevant covariates.ResultsAverage social media use was 1 to &lt;3hours per day (31.6%, n=3720). 33.7% were classed as low users (&lt;1hour; n=3986); 13.9% were high users (3 to &lt;5hours; n=1602) and 20.8% were very high users (5+ hours; n=2203). Girls reported spending more time on social media than boys. Overall, heavier social media use was associated with poorer sleep patterns, controlling for covariates. For example, very high social media users were more likely than comparable average users to report late sleep onset (OR 2.14, 95%CI 1.83 to 2.50) and wake times (OR 1.97, 95%CI 1.32 to 2.93) on school days and trouble falling back asleep after nighttime awakening (OR 1.36, 95%CI 1.10 to 1.66).ConclusionsThis study provides a normative profile of UK adolescent social media use and sleep.

We ask how well Big Tech companies fulfill their role as gatekeepers of the public square. We ponder whether their dominant market positions merit an antitrust response. We assess their culpability and complicity in spreading online misinformation and hate. However, in the many normative debates over how Big Tech should use its power, the source of that power remains largely unexamined. Big Tech, like Big Tobacco before it, is an industry founded on addiction. Although typically free to use, the worlds largest digital platforms exploit users dopamine pathways to consume as much of their time and conscious attention as possible. Many of the problems currently gripping the public consciousness would be fundamentally less important if these platforms were not powerfully addictive. They would be private problems issues to be resolved between the company and its users. A key reason they are significant, public problems that society can no longer ignore is that Big Tech has intentionally addicted billions of people. The business model of many large technology companies, or significant subsidiaries thereof, is built on maximizing the frequency and duration of use, what the industry refers to as time on device. In this, they have been remarkably successful. The average American spends just over 40% of their waking hours online, with that number approaching 60% for American teens. A growing body of research problematizes the choice to spend this much time online. Todays dominant digital platforms are intentionally designed to produce structural and functional changes in various regions of the brain and to trigger the same brain reward pathways as nicotine and other addictive drugs. Thus far, such platforms have managed to almost entirely avoid liability for harms associated with their use. This Article surveys existing tools that may help to combat Big Techs manipulative design practices. It finds that existing laws and legal duties fail to protect users from exploitation. Accordingly, this Article proposes designating the largest manipulative technology platforms as systemically important platforms. Platforms so designated would be legally required to open their platforms to middleware, a type of software that can modify how data is presented. Such middleware would feature a control panel of tools that would enable users to curate their digital experience. In addition, these platforms would be subject to increased tax burdens and enhanced regulatory scrutiny with the goal of curbing manipulative design practices and providing billions of users with greater agency.

We find that the most recent studies report mainly positive Flynn effects in economically less developed countries, but trivial and frequently negative Flynn effects in the economically most advanced countries. This is confirmed by an analysis of 48 countries in the 20002018 PISA tests, showing that high pre-existing IQ and school achievement are the best predictors of declining test scores. IQ gaps between countries are still large (e.g., 19 IQ points in PISA between East Asia and South Asia) but are diminishing world-wide. We predict that these trends, observed in adolescents today, will reduce cognitive gaps between the working-age populations of countries and world regions during coming decades. As is predicted by the well-established relationship between intelligence and economic growth, there is already evidence that the ongoing cognitive convergence is paralleled by global economic convergence. These developments raise questions as to how long this cognitive and economic convergence will continue, whether it will eliminate cognitive and economic gaps between countries entirely, and whether a condition with high levels of cognitive ability and economic prosperity is sustainable long-term.",Changes in Cognitive Ability A Review

The purpose of this study was to determine whether these two trends are directly associated by using multi-year person-level data to test whether the association of year with suicidal behavior was mediated by digital media use. Data were from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (20092017), a nationally-representative biennial cross-sectional self-report survey of U.S. students (N = 72,942). Mediation analysis was used to estimate the proportion of cross-year changes in suicidal behavior that were mediated by concurrent changes in leisure-time digital media use. Past-year suicidal behavior in 2011 (19.6%), 2013 (20.4%), 2015 (21.7%), and 2017 (20.5%) increased relative to 2009 (17.1%).

Online social media and associated social networks are an increasingly important forum for public debate and are known to influence individual attitudes and behaviours  yet online discussions and social networks related to climate change are not well understood. Here we construct several forms of social network for users communicating about climate change on the popular microblogging platform Twitter. We classify user attitudes to climate change based on message content and find that social networks are characterised by strong attitude-based homophily and segregation into polarised sceptic and activist groups. Most users interact only with like-minded others, in communities dominated by a single view. However, we also find mixed-attitude communities in which sceptics and activists frequently interact. Messages between like-minded users typically carry positive sentiment, while messages between sceptics and activists carry negative sentiment. We identify a number of general patterns in user behaviours relating to engagement with alternative views. Users who express negative sentiment are themselves the target of negativity. Users in mixed-attitude communities are less likely to hold a strongly polarised view, but more likely to express negative sentiment towards other users with differing views. Overall, social media discussions of climate change often occur within polarising echo chambers, but also within open forums, mixed-attitude communities that reduce polarisation and stimulate debate. Our results have implications for public engagement with this important global challenge.",Social Media and Political Dysfunction

A sample from the baseline assessment of the ABCD 2.0.1 release in 2019 was largely recruited across 21 sites in the US through public, private, and charter elementary schools using a population neuroscience approach to recruitment, aiming to mirror demographic variation in the US population. Children with valid neuroimaging and behavioral data were included. Some exclusions included common MRI contraindications, history of major neurologic disorders, and history of traumatic brain injury. Collected data were analyzed between October 2019 and October 2020.<jats:sec id=""ab-zoi221006-7"">ExposuresParticipants completed a self-reported screen time survey, including an item asking children to report the time specifically spent on video gaming.

Mental health symptoms were evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist and included raw scores of behavioral (anxiety, depression, somatic, social, attention, rule breaking, and aggression concerns) and psychiatric categories (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, diagnoses of depression, anxiety, somaticism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional-defiant disorder, and conduct disorder).<jats:sec id=""ab-zoi221006-9"">ResultsA total of 2217 children (mean [SD] age, 9.91 [0.62] years; 1399 [63.1%] female) participated in this study. The final sample used in the stop signal task analyses consisted of 1128 NVGs (0 gaming hours per week) and 679 VGs who played at least 21 hours per week. The final sample used in the n-back analyses consisted of 1278 NVGs who had never played video games (0 hours per week of gaming) and 800 VGs who played at least 21 hours per week. The NVG vs VG groups did not differ on age, body mass index, or IQ, but did differ on sex, race and ethnicity, and combined parental income. The Child Behavior Checklist behavioral and mental health scores were higher in VGs, with attention problems, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder scores significantly higher in the VGs compared with the NVGs. The VGs performed better on both fMRI tasks compared with the NVGs; the differences were statistically significant but small. VGs had significantly shorter mean (SE) stop signal reaction times compared with NVGs (287.3 [9.8] vs 300.1 [9.6] milliseconds; P=.018) and correct mean (SE) go reaction times (514 [2.9] vs 552 [2.2] milliseconds; P=.001). Following a similar pattern, 0-back D' mean (SE) measures of the n-back task were significantly higher in VGs compared with NVGs (2.33 [0.03] vs 2.18 [0.03] milliseconds; P&amp;amp;lt;.001). Similarly, 2-back D mean (SE) measures were significantly higher in VGs relative to NVGs (1.87 [0.03] vs 1.72 [0.02] milliseconds P&amp;amp;lt;.002), and correct mean (SE) 2-back RT measures were significantly shorter in VGs relative to NVGs (1025 [4.8] vs 1069 [3.7] milliseconds; P&amp;amp;lt;.002). Nonparametric analyses of fMRI data demonstrated a greater BOLD signal in VGs in the precuneus during inhibitory control. During working memory, a smaller BOLD signal was observed in VGs in parts of the occipital cortex and calcarine sulcus and a larger BOLD signal in the cingulate, middle, and frontal gyri and the precuneus.Conclusions and RelevanceIn this study, compared with NVGs, VGs were found to exhibit better cognitive performance involving response inhibition and working memory, as well as altered BOLD signal in key regions of the cortex responsible for visual, attention, and memory processing. The differences in reaction times, although small, were consistent with an association between videogaming and cognitive abilities that involve response inhibition and working memory and the underlying cortical pathways.

Data from 98 independent studies with 36,965 participants revealed that for both violent video games and prosocial video games, there was a significant association with social outcomes. Whereas violent video games increase aggression and aggression-related variables and decrease prosocial outcomes, prosocial video games have the opposite effects. These effects were reliable across experimental, correlational, and longitudinal studies, indicating that video game exposure causally affects social outcomes and that there are both short- and long-term effects.",Video Game Use and Adolescent Health A Collaborative Review

We sampled adolescents experiences six times per day for one week to quantify differences in their susceptibility to the effects of social media on their momentary affective well-being. Rigorous analyses of 2,155 real-time assessments showed that the association between social media use and affective well-being differs strongly across adolescents: While 44% did not feel better or worse after passive social media use, 46% felt better, and 10% felt worse.

There is little research on such a relationship in adult samples. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of video game volume with sleep quality in adults via face-to-face interviews using standardized questionnaires. Adults (n = 844, 56.2% women), aged 1894 years old, participated in the study. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and gaming volume was assessed by asking the hours of gaming on a regular weekday (MonThurs), Friday and weekend day (SatSun). Adjusting for gender, age, educational level, exercise and perceived stress, results of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that video gaming volume was a significant predictor of sleep quality ( = 0.145), fatigue ( = 0.109), insomnia ( = 0.120), bedtime ( = 0.100) and rise time ( = 0.168). Each additional hour of video gaming per day delayed bedtime by 6.9 min (95% confidence interval 2.011.9 min) and rise time by 13.8 min (95% confidence interval 7.819.7 min). Attributable risk for having poor sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index > 5) due to gaming >1 h day was 30%. When examining the components of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index using multinomial regression analysis (odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals), gaming volume significantly predicted sleep latency, sleep efficiency and use of sleep medication. In general, findings support the conclusion that gaming volume is negatively related to the overall sleep quality of adults, which might be due to underlying mechanisms of screen exposure and arousal.",Video Game Use and Adolescent Health A Collaborative Review

The consequences of these changes for mental health are debated but require further empirical evaluation. METHODS: Using data from the Childhood to Adolescence Transition Study (n=1,156), duration of social networking use was measured annually at four time points from 11.9 to 14.8 years of age (1h/day indicating high use). Cross-sectional and prospective relationships between social networking use and depressive and anxiety symptoms were examined. RESULTS: In adjusted (age, socioeconomic status, prior mental health history) cross-sectional analyses, females with high social networking use had greater odds of depressive (odds ratio [OR]: 2.15; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.58-2.91) and anxiety symptoms (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.32-3.00) than those that used a few minutes at most, while males with high social networking use had 1.60 greater odds of reporting depressive symptoms (95% CI: 1.09-2.35). For females, an increased odds of depressive symptoms at age 14.8 was observed for high social networking use at one previous wave and at two or three previous waves, even after adjustment (OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.11-2.78; OR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.27-3.37, respectively) compared to no wave of high use.

This report from the Stirling County Study compares rates of current depression among representative samples of adults from a population in Atlantic Canada. Methods Sample sizes were 1003, 1201, and 1396 in 1952, 1970, and 1992, respectively. The depression component of the study's method, the DPAX (DP for depression and AX for anxiety), was employed. The original procedure (DPAX-1) was applied in all years. A revision (DPAX-2) was used in 1970 and 1992. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) was also used in 1992. Results With the DPAX-1, the overall prevalence of current depression was steady at 5% over the 2 early samples but declined in 1992 because of vernacular changes referring to dysphoria. The DPAX-2 gave a stable overall prevalence of 5% in the 2 recent samples, but indicated that women and younger people were at greater risk in 1992 than in 1970. The DIS, like the DPAX-2, found a current 1992 rate of 5% for major depressive episodes combined with dysthymia. Recalled lifetime rates using the DIS showed the same profile interpreted in other studies as suggesting an increase in depression over time. Conclusions Three samples over a 40-year period showed a stable current prevalence of depression using the DPAX methods that was comparable in 1992 with the current rates using the DIS. This casts doubt on the interpretation that depression is generally increasing. Within the overall steady rate observed in this study, historical change was a matter of redistribution by sex and age, with a higher rate among younger women being of recent origin.",Alternative Hypotheses to the Adolescent Mental Illness Crisis A Collaborative Review

We document three key findings. First, using data from the National Vital Statistics System from 1990-2019, we document the historical association between teen suicides and the school calendar. We show that suicides among 12-to-18-year-olds are highest during months of the school year and lowest during summer months (June through August) and also establish that areas with schools starting in early August experience increases in teen suicides in August, while areas with schools starting in September dont see youth suicides rise until September. Second, we show that this seasonal pattern dramatically changed in 2020. Teen suicides plummeted in March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began in the U.S. and remained low throughout the summer before rising in Fall 2020 when many K-12 schools returned to in-person instruction. Third, using county-level variation in school reopenings in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021proxied by anonymized SafeGraph smartphone data on elementary and secondary school foot trafficwe find that returning from online to in-person schooling was associated with a 12-to-18 percent increase teen suicides.

A passive sensing measurement was also included at the final wave of data collection to obtain a more accurate and complete picture of phone use in particular. The use of entertainment apps was risky for girls while reading apps were risky for boys. Additionally, video game use (for boys) was associated with suicide risk when cyberbullying was also high. Identifying nonnormative patterns of media during adolescence may be instructive in terms of suicide prevention efforts.",Social Media and Mental Health

We study this question using longitudinal data that describe the attitudes and online behaviors of 1,239 Republican and Democratic Twitter users from late 2017 merged with nonpublic data about the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) from Twitter. Using Bayesian regression tree models, we find no evidence that interaction with IRA accounts substantially impacted 6 distinctive measures of political attitudes and behaviors over a 1-mo period. We also find that interaction with IRA accounts were most common among respondents with strong ideological homophily within their Twitter network, high interest in politics, and high frequency of Twitter usage. Together, these findings suggest that Russian trolls might have failed to sow discord because they mostly interacted with those who were already highly polarized. We conclude by discussing several important limitations of our studyespecially our inability to determine whether IRA accounts influenced the 2016 presidential electionas well as its implications for future research on social media influence campaigns, political polarization, and computational social science.",Social Media and Political Dysfunction

Here we demonstrate one mechanism that contributes to the believability of fake news: fluency via prior exposure. Using actual fake-news headlines presented as they were seen on Facebook, we show that even a single exposure increases subsequent perceptions of accuracy, both within the same session and after a week. Moreover, this illusory truth effect for fake-news headlines occurs despite a low level of overall believability and even when the stories are labeled as contested by fact checkers or are inconsistent with the readers political ideology. These results suggest that social media platforms help to incubate belief in blatantly false news stories and that tagging such stories as disputed is not an effective solution to this problem. It is interesting, however, that we also found that prior exposure does not impact entirely implausible statements (e.g., The earth is a perfect square). These observations indicate that although extreme implausibility is a boundary condition of the illusory truth effect, only a small degree of potential plausibility is sufficient for repetition to increase perceived accuracy.

Abstracted information included documented social media use, demographic variables, documented self-injurious behaviors, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Suicide Status Form-II. Logistic regression was implemented to examine the effect of social media use on the risk of self-injurious behaviors and suicidality. Results Fifty-six adolescents who used social media were identified and matched with 56 non-social media users. Those with reported social media use had significantly greater odds of self-injurious behaviors at admission (odds ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence intervals, 1.17-5.71; P = .02) vs youth without reported social media use. Adolescents with reported social media use also had greater odds of increased suicidal ideation and suicide risk than those with no reported use, but these relationships were not statistically significant. Conclusions Social media use in adolescents with a psychiatric admission may be associated with the risk of self-injurious behaviors and could be a marker of impulsivity.

To achieve these aims, we used data from the nationwide Ungdata surveys conducted annually at the municipality level in Norway, comprising 419,934 adolescents aged 13-18 from six survey years (2014-2019). Six items assessed PHC, including neck and shoulder pain, headache, and abdominal pain, during the past month. To account for the nesting structure of Ungdata, and to exploit the variation within and between municipalities, we used multilevel analyses with adolescents nested in municipality-years (n = 669), nested in municipalities (n = 345). We found a small to moderate linear increase in number of PHC among boys and girls from 2014 to 2019. Screen time and social media use moderately attenuated the trend for girls, and to a lesser extent for boys. Screen time and social media use were further positively associated with PHC across the between and within-municipality levels, and social media use was more strongly associated with PHC for girls than boys across all levels of analysis. A similar pattern emerged when considering each symptom individually. The results suggest that the prevalence of PHC rose in tandem with a group-level shift towards higher screen time and social media use.

This article uses qualitative interviews with 17 internet users to explore the foundations of trust in online friendships, drawing on Piotr Sztompkas theoretical framework. It concludes that there are four main sources of online trust. First, reputation, whether grounded in a pseudonym or offline identity. Second, performance, due to the scope for enhanced performance in online communication. More than this, performance plays an especially important role in the building of online friendship, following Giddens model of the pure relationship (1991). Third, pre-commitment, through self-disclosure, which in turn encourages a leap of faith and reciprocal self-disclosure.

However, previous studies suffer from methodological weaknesses that may have caused biased results. There is need for further investigation that benefits from the use of methods that avoid omitted variable bias. Methods: Two wave panel data was used from two surveys of 1,928 Norwegian adolescents aged 13 to 17 years. The surveys included measures of video game use, video game addiction, depression, heavy episodic drinking, academic achievement, and conduct problems. The data was analyzed using first-differencing, a regression method that is unbiased by time invariant individual factors. Results: Video game addiction was related to depression, lower academic achievement, and conduct problems, but time spent on video games was not related to any of the studied negative outcomes. Discussion: The findings were in line with a growing number of studies that have failed to find relationships between time spent on video games and negative outcomes. The current study is also consistent with previous studies in that video game addiction was related to other negative outcomes, but it made the added contribution that the relationships are unbiased by time invariant individual effects. However, future research should aim at establishing the temporal order of the supposed causal effects. Conclusions: Spending time playing video games does not involve negative consequences, but adolescents who experience problems related to video games are likely to also experience problems in other facets of life.",Video Game Use and Adolescent Health A Collaborative Review

Within the US, gains of 3 points per decade have been accepted as consistent across age and ability level, suggesting that tests with outdated norms yield spuriously high IQs. However, findings are generally based on small samples, have not been validated across ability levels, and conflict with reverse effects recently identified in Scandinavia and other countries. Using a well-validated measure of fluid intelligence, we investigated the Flynn Effect by comparing scores normed in 1989 and 2003, among a representative sample of American adolescents ages 1318 (n = 10,073). Additionally, we examined Flynn Effect variation by age, sex, ability level, parental age, and SES. Adjusted mean IQ differences per decade were calculated using generalized linear models. Overall the Flynn Effect was not significant; however, effects varied substantially by age and ability level. IQs increased 2.3 points at age 13 (95% CI = 2.0, 2.7), but decreased 1.6 points at age 18 (95% CI = 2.1, 1.2). IQs decreased 4.9 points for those with IQ  70 (95% CI = 4.9, 4.8), but increased 3.5 points among those with IQ  130 (95% CI = 3.4, 3.6). The Flynn Effect was not meaningfully related to other background variables. Using the largest sample of US adolescent IQs to date, we demonstrate significant heterogeneity in fluid IQ changes over time. Reverse Flynn Effects at age 18 are consistent with previous data, and those with lower ability levels are exhibiting worsening IQ over time.

In line with moralists contentions, pornography consumption was associated with having more positive attitudes toward teenage sex, adult premarital sex, and extramarital sex. Pornography consumption was also positively related to actually engaging in extramarital sex. In line with public health researchers concerns, pornography consumption was associated with having more sexual partners and engaging in paid sex behavior.

Since 1974 in the U.S., over 1.6 billion kilograms of glyphosate active ingredient have been applied, or 19% of estimated global use of glyphosate (8.6 billion kilograms). Globally, glyphosate use has risen almost 15-fold since so-called Roundup Ready, genetically engineered glyphosate-tolerant crops were introduced in 1996. Two-thirds of the total volume of glyphosate applied in the U.S. from 1974 to 2014 has been sprayed in just the last 10years. The corresponding share globally is 72%.

We know little about longitudinal associations between social media use and important psychological variables such as self-esteem. Using experience sampling methodology, this study examined the relationship between social media use and self-esteem in a new and ecologically valid way. Participants ( N = 200) responded to notifications sent to their smartphones several times a day for 2 weeks and reported social media use as well as current self-esteem. Multilevel analyses revealed distinct gendered patterns: Low initial self-esteem among women predicted more frequent social media use, whereas low initial self-esteem among men was related to less frequent social media use. Moreover, recent social media use predicted lower current self-esteem for women, but not for men. Low stability of self-esteem was related to more social media use, independent of gender. The findings support the notion of a reciprocal relationship between social media use and self-esteem for women, where self-esteem level may motivate women to use social media more frequently and social media may be a source of lower self-esteem.

Most research has been correlational with little experimental or longitudinal work. Cross-cultural comparison could be illuminating. A comparison of Italian and British children and their mothers was conducted. Methods A sample of 8- to 10-year old children, 60 Italian and 49 English, completed the Spence Child Anxiety Scale. Mothers also completed two questionnaires of parenting: the Skills of Daily Living Checklist (assessing maternal autonomy granting) and the ParentChild Interaction Questionnaire (assessing maternal intrusiveness). Parenting was assessed in two video-recorded blindly rated motherchild interaction tasks, the belt-buckling tasks and the etch-a-sketch, providing objective indices of overcontrol, warmth, lack of autonomy granting, and overprotection. Results There were no differences between the children in overall anxiety and specific forms of anxiety. Parenting, however, was markedly different for the two countries. Compared to English mothers, on the two questionnaires, Italian mothers were significantly less autonomy granting and more intrusive; and in terms of the observed indices, a significantly greater proportion of the Italian mothers displayed a high level of both overprotection and overcontrol, and a low level of autonomy granting. Notably, Italian mothers evidenced significantly more warmth than English mothers; and maternal warmth was found to moderate the impact of self-reported maternal intrusiveness on the level of both overall child anxiety and the level of child separation anxiety; and it also moderated the relationship between both observed maternal intrusiveness and overall child anxiety and observed maternal overprotectiveness and child separation anxiety. Conclusions Although, compared to the British mothers, the Italian mothers were more likely to evidence high levels of parenting behaviours previously found to be anxiogenic, the high levels of warmth displayed by these mothers to their children appears to have INCONCLUSIVEised the adverse impact of these behaviours.",Free Play and Mental Health Collaborative Review

The existing scholarship so far focuses primarily on the role of content and social media distribution and pays little attention to the audiences of right-wing alternative media, especially at a cross-national level and in the European context. The present paper addresses this gap by exploring the characteristics of the audiences of right-wing alternative online media. Based on a secondary data analysis of the 2019 Reuters Digital News Survey, this article presents a cross-national analysis of right-wing alternative media use in Northern and Central Europe. The results indicate a comparatively high prevalence of right-wing alternative online media in Sweden, whereas in Germany, Austria, and Finland, these news websites seem to be far less popular. With regard to audience characteristics, the strongest predictors of right-wing alternative online media use are political interest and a critical stance towards immigration, accompanied by a skeptical assessment of news quality, in general, and distrust, especially in public service broadcasting media. Additionally, the use of social media as a primary news source increases the likelihood of right-wing alternative news consumption. This corroborates the high relevance of social media platforms as distributors and multipliers of right-wing alternative news content. The findings suggest that right-wing alternative online media should not be underestimated as a peripheral phenomenon, but rather have to be considered influential factors for center-right to radical right-leaning politics and audiences in public discourse, with a high mobilizing and polarizing potential.",Social Media and Political Dysfunction

Contrary to prediction, we find that the average account posts links to more politically moderate news sources than the ones they receive in their own feed. However, members of a tiny network core do exhibit cross-sectional evidence of polarization and are responsible for the majority of tweets received overall due to their popularity and activity, which could explain the widespread perception of polarization on social media.",Social Media and Political Dysfunction

The participants were 420 female RED users (aged 1835) who were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) the influencer-high group (idealized imagery alongside high engagement metrics); (2) the influencer-low group (the same idealized imagery adjusted for low engagement metrics); or (3) a control set of nature images. The results revealed that the groups exposed to influencer imagery had lower body satisfaction and more negative mood than the control group (nature images). Notably, this comparison showed no significant difference between the low-influencer and high-influencer groups in body satisfaction and mood. Additionally, this effect was moderated by individuals self-discrepancy between personal ideals and their own bodies.

In a major extension of existing research, we show that positive short-term effects of platforms mask detrimental long-term effects. Drawing on a four-month tracking dataset and a comprehensive content analysis covering the online news consumption of over 10,000 German citizens, we demonstrate that even though short-term usage of platforms uniformly increases exposure diversity, long-term reliance can lead to decreases. In addition, platforms vary in their influences: News aggregators are beneficial to exposure diversity, while Twitter and search engines have a limiting effect; Facebook offers no significant influence.",Social Media and Political Dysfunction

Two varieties of social support were considered, according to the communication channel: offline and online. In a sample of 309 Facebook users (age: M(SD) = 23.76(4.06), range: 18-56), daily stress was positively related to the intensity of Facebook use and to tendencies towards Facebook addiction. The link between daily stress and intensity of Facebook use was negatively moderated by perceived offline social support, indicating that individuals who received low levels of support offline were particularly likely to increase their Facebook use at higher levels of daily stress. Perceived online social support partly mediated the positive relationship between Facebook use intensity and tendencies towards FAD. It is remarkable that Facebook use intensity is systematically related to both positive (i.e., receiving online social support) and negative (i.e., building up FAD) consequences. Thereby, individuals who receive high levels of social support online tend to be at risk for tendencies towards FAD. Thus, while offline social support might protect mental health, online support might influence it negatively. This should be considered when assessing individuals at risk for obsessive Facebook use and when planning interventions to deal with FAD.",Social Media and Mental Health

Patients from eligible English practices were linked to hospital episode statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality records.Participants For the descriptive analytical phases we examined data pertaining to 16 912 patients aged 10-19 who harmed themselves during 2001-14. For analysis of cause specific mortality following self harm, 8638 patients eligible for HES and ONS linkage were matched by age, sex, and general practice with up to 20 unaffected children and adolescents (n=170 274).Main outcome measures In the first phase, temporal trends in sex and age specific annual incidence were examined. In the second phase, clinical management was assessed according to the likelihood of referral to mental health services and psychotropic drug prescribing. In the third phase, relative risks of all cause mortality, unnatural death (including suicide and accidental death), and fatal acute alcohol or drug poisoning were estimated as hazard ratios derived from stratified Cox proportional hazards models for the self harm cohort versus the matched unaffected comparison cohort.Results The annual incidence of self harm was observed to increase in girls (37.4 per 10 000) compared with boys (12.3 per 10 000), and a sharp 68% increase occurred among girls aged 13-16, from 45.9 per 10 000 in 2011 to 77.0 per 10 000 in 2014. Referrals within 12 months of the index self harm episode were 23% less likely for young patients registered at the most socially deprived practices, even though incidences were considerably higher in these localities. Children and adolescents who harmed themselves were approximately nine times more likely to die unnaturally during follow-up, with especially noticeable increases in risks of suicide (deprivation adjusted hazard ratio 17.5, 95% confidence interval 7.6 to 40.5) and fatal acute alcohol or drug poisoning (34.3, 10.2 to 115.7).Conclusions Gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the recent apparent increase in the incidence of self harm among early-mid teenage girls, and coordinated initiatives to tackle health inequalities in the provision of services to distressed children and adolescents, represent urgent priorities for multiple public agencies.",Adolescent mood disorders since 2010

It has been suggested that play serves as a INCONCLUSIVEizing medium by which young children manipulate a traumatic or anxietyinducing situation in an attempt to gain mastery over the event. Observations of young children at play have provided some anecdotal evidence, but as yet there has been no systematic investigation of the hypotheses drawn from the psychoanalytic paradigm. The present study induced a conflict situation in preschool children and compared their subsequent play behavior to a matched INCONCLUSIVE group. Pre and postphysiological and behavioral measures of anxiety and emotional displeasure were taken, and durations of categories of play related to the source of the conflict were recorded. Results supported the view that play provides for the expression, and hence reduction, of an unpleasant event, in that the conflict group showed a reliable decrease in anxiety after play, and the play was related significantly more to the source of the anxiety than was the play of the INCONCLUSIVE control group.",Free Play and Mental Health Collaborative Review

While algorithm-driven sites are increasingly popular sources of information, we know very little about the effects of algorithmically determined news at the individual level. The objective of this paper is to define and measure the effects of algorithmically generated news. We begin by developing a taxonomy of news delivery by distinguishing between two types of algorithmically generated news, socially driven and user-driven, and contrasting these with non-algorithmic news. We follow with an exploratory analysis of the effects of these news delivery modes on political behavior, specifically political participation and polarization. Using two nationally representative surveys, one of young adults and one of the general population, we find that getting news from sites that use socially driven or user-driven algorithms to generate content corresponds with higher levels of political participation, but that getting news from non-algorithmic sources does not. We also find that neither non-algorithmic nor algorithmically determined news contribute to higher levels of partisan polarization.

Although it is possible for both genders to experience a problematic relationship with pornography, the large majority of online pornography consumers who identify as addicted to pornography are heterosexual men. This article aims to examine the experiences of adult heterosexual men with problematic pornography use in New Zealand. A total of 15 heterosexual men were recruited via advertising, social media outreach, and word of mouth to take part in interviews about their self-perceived problematic pornography consumption habits. A data-driven inductive thematic analysis was conducted to explore the different ways men talked about their problematic pornography use. The primary reason men kept their viewing hidden from the world was because of the accompanying experiences of guilt and shame that would inevitably follow mostif not allviewing sessions or attempts at opening up about their use. Pornography began eroding their sense of autonomy when men experienced a loss of control over their use, which underpinned the core aspect of their problematic use. Over time, the men perceived that pornography had resulted in having unrealistic expectations when it came to sex and sexuality, the way they viewed women, and led to diminished sexual function. Further work is needed in using strategies that could offer alternatives to problematic pornographic use or interventions that help the individual learn how to productively respond to the affective triggers of discomfort that trigger use.

Further, we probed whether sex modulated the relationships between smartphone-mediated behaviours and distress outcomes. Using structural equation modelling, we analysed data from young adults (N = 364) and evaluated the associations of smartphone-related behavioursproblematic use, phone checking, and overall screen timewith depression, anxiety, and stress. We found that phone-checking frequency predicted greater depression, anxiety, and stress levels, while problematic smartphone use predicted anxiety levels above and beyond the effects of other indices. Further, smartphone screen time predicted depression, but not other distress-related outcomes. We also found an interaction effect such that the positive relation between problematic smartphone use and stress was more pronounced for females than males. Our results held true when key covariates (age, sex, socioeconomic status, negative affect, and neuroticism) were accounted for. These findings underscore the importance of distinguishing indices of smartphone use in relation to psychological distress.",Social Media and Mental Health

The study sample consisted of 3,501 adolescents in grade 8 (1415 years, 51.5%, n = 1,765 girls) followed for 2 consecutive years. Daily social media use was measured as weighted average of self-reported use in weekdays and weekend days. Mental health was measured with the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). A Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model was applied to distinguish between-person from within-person associations between social media use and symptoms of mental ill-health.ResultsMedian SDQ score at baseline was 9 (interquartile range [IQR] 614). Median social media use was 1.7 hours at baseline (interquartile range .63.0) and increased over the 3-year period. Adolescents with more social media use also reported higher SDQ scores, B (95% confidence interval [CI]) = 2.40 (2.032.77). On a within-person level, no cross-lagged associations were found between changes in social media use and subsequent changes in symptoms of mental ill-health after 1 year, B (95% CI) = .02 (.12 to .16) or vice versa B (95% CI) = .00 (.02 to .02). Weak cross-sectional associations were found between changes in social media use and concurrent changes in symptoms of mental ill-health, B (95% CI) = .24 (.00.48).ConclusionsAdolescents with higher use of social media report more symptoms of mental health problems, but there is no evidence for a longitudinal association between increased use and mental health problems.

The echo chambers view focuses on the highly fragmented, customized, and niche-oriented aspects of social media and suggests these venues foster greater political polarization of public opinion. An alternative, which we term the crosscutting interactions view, focuses on the openness of the Internet and social media, with different opinions just a click away. This view thus argues that polarization would not be especially problematic on these outlets. Exploiting the variation among members of the U.S. House of Representatives in measured positions of political ideology, this study estimates the association between politicians' ideological positions and the size of their Twitter readership. The evidence shows a strong polarization on Twitter readership, which supports the echo chambers view.

Recent findings Current data indicate that cannabis use among adolescents has shown both marginal increases and decreases, depending on global location; however, the profile of cannabinoids in cannabis may now be biased toward those that promote psychotogenic and memory-impairing effects. CUD has been found most prevalent among youth. After controlling for multiple confounders, longitudinal research suggests that cannabis use predicts the development of anxiety disorders, depression, suicidal ideation, certain personality disorders, and interpersonal violence. Further, associations have been found stronger in adolescents relative to adults, and younger age of initiation increases the risk of developing mental health disorders. Summary Cannabis use among youth remains prevalent, and recent studies are consolidating previous findings that adolescents are especially vulnerable to mental health disorders associated with cannabis. This suggests that cannabis involvement requires increased prominence in research, prevention initiatives, routine screening, and interventions to improve adolescent mental health.",Alternative Hypotheses to the Adolescent Mental Illness Crisis A Collaborative Review

On the basis of empirical results from an extensive Swedish survey study, we discuss and analyze how gender differences are articulated. We are specifically interested in what kinds of attitudes young men and young women develop. A common conception of gender and the consumption of pornography is that men and boys are generally the consumers, whereas women dislike pornography. Results from the present study partly support these claims. However, we argue that it is important to analyze differences within the categories men and women. Here, we find that many young men are actually hold negative attitudes toward pornography, whereas some young women are positively disposed toward and enjoy pornography. These findings are discussed within the framework of gender theory and theories of masculinity.",Porn Use and Adolescent Health A Collaborative Review

In a national analysis of Canadian adolescents, we explored how such exposures, as well as self-perceptions of connectedness with nature, each related to the prevalence of recurrent psychosomatic symptoms. The data source for this cross-sectional study, consisting of a weighted sample of 29,784 students aged 11-15 years from 377 schools, was the 2013/2014 cycle of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study. We modeled reports of exposure to the outdoors and then perceived connection(s) to nature as correlates of reduced psychosomatic symptoms. Associations varied by sex. Among girls, spending on average >0.5 h/week outdoors was associated with a 24% (95% CI: 5%, 40%) lower prevalence of high psychosomatic symptoms, compared to those who averaged no time playing outdoors. No such relationship was observed among boys. Perception of connection to nature as 'important' was similarly associated with a 25% (95% CI: 9%, 38%) reduction in the prevalence of high psychosomatic symptoms; this association did not differ by sex or age. Our analysis highlights the potential importance of adolescent engagement with nature as protective for their psychological well-being. It also emphasizes the importance of accounting for differences between boys and girls when researching, planning, and implementing public mental health initiatives that consider exposure to the outdoors.",Free Play and Mental Health Collaborative Review

",https://doi.org/10.1111/tran.12230,"Reconceptualising play: Balancing childcare, extra-curricular activities and free play in contemporary childhoods","This paper rethinks geographical approaches to children's play in the Global North. One narrowly conceived strand of past research considered the erosion of outdoor free play, but overlooked children's views of alternative play environments (e.g., out-of-school activities). A separate thread examined the feminisation of employment and growth in childcare, but investigations into children's play in care-based environments are rare, and explorations of their ability to balance different play landscapes are lacking. This paper builds on insights from both lines of research, and challenges their deficiencies, to map out a more broadly conceived geography of play. Drawing on rigorous quantitative and qualitative research with middle- and working-class parents and children, the paper examines the socially differentiated reconciliation of neighbourhood, extra-curricular and care-based play in contemporary British childhoods. The analysis highlights stark class differences in the balance between these play environments. Middle-class children's elective engagement in extra-curricular activities results in reduced outdoor free play, but they have little control over the total time they play in care environments. Working-class children have greater experience of playing out, but are underscheduled as they have less than desired access to play in structured activities and wraparound care. In conclusion, the paper argues that geographers must: (1) move beyond the romanticisation of free play and recognise children's right to participate in a diversity of playful spaces; (2) embrace an intergenerational approach which recognises that play is not a matter for children alone  adults can facilitate as well as limit play, but reliance on women's unpaid labour makes play a feminist issue; and (3) uncover play's role in social reproduction as wider inequalities emerge in, and are reproduced through, children's landscapes of play in times of austerity, whether as here in terms of class, or along other axes of social differentiation or location.",Free Play and Mental Health Collaborative Review

Results indicated that age of smartphone acquisition was largely not predictive of later well-being (i.e., depression, loneliness, life satisfaction, interpersonal communication, cell phone addiction). A qualitative content analysis approach was used to identify the participants experiences with smartphone acquisition during adolescence.

We used 3 waves (2013, 2014, and 2015) of data from 5,208 subjects in the nationally representative Gallup Panel Social Network Study survey, including social network measures, in combination with objective measures of Facebook use. We investigated the associations of Facebook activity and real-world social network activity with self-reported physical health, self-reported mental health, self-reported life satisfaction, and body mass index. Our results showed that overall, the use of Facebook was negatively associated with well-being. For example, a 1-standard-deviation increase in likes clicked (clicking like on someone else's content), links clicked (clicking a link to another site or article), or status updates (updating one's own Facebook status) was associated with a decrease of 5%8% of a standard deviation in self-reported mental health.

Overall, 503 persons from Germany (Mage=29.19, SDage=10.51, range: 1879) participated in the study. Over 14days, the three experimental groups (a) reduced their daily smartphone use time by 60minutes, (b) increased their daily level of physical activity by 30minutes, and (c) combined both measures. The control group continued its behavior as usual. Outcomes were assessed via online surveys at five measurement time points (baseline, intermediate, post-intervention, and 1 and 3 months after the intervention). Results All interventions resulted in a significant increase in weekly physical activity and in reduced symptoms of PSU, depression, and anxiety. Furthermore, the smartphone reduction and the combination of both measures contributed to a significant reduction of participants daily smartphone use and higher levels of PMH. The effects of the reduction of smartphone use time and its combination with increased physical activity were more stable in the longer term than the increase in physical activity only. Conclusion Combined with an increase in physical activity, the reduction of smartphone use time could serve as an efficient and cost-effective measure for the prevention of PSU and the promotion of mental health.",Social Media and Mental Health

States with higher admissions rates are darker and states with lower rates are lighter. Marijuana legalization status appears in the inset map. Abbreviations: CBD, cannabidiol; THC, tetrahydrocannabinol. Admissions rates increased over the study period in only 7 states, 6 of which (excepting North Dakota) have low mean admissions rates.

All 12 states in the high mean admissions rate class sustained admissions declines, with 10 of those states having declines in the steepest category. Admissions rates declined during the study period in 40 of the 47 states mapped. KEY FINDINGS: HIGHLIGHTS: The map, visually dominated by blue tones, clearly shows that adolescent treatment admissions for marijuana declined in most of states. The mean annual admissions rate for all states declined over the study period by nearly half, from 60 (admissions per 10,000 adolescents) in 2008 to 31 in 2017, with state admissions rate slopes ranging from ?0.42 to 0.19 (median = 0.28). State admissions rates in 2008 ranged from fewer than 1 to 218 (median = 52); in 2017 they ranged from fewer than 1 to 167 (median = 21). Admissions rates increased over the study period in only 7 states, 6 of which (excepting North Dakota) have relatively low mean admissions rates (states colored lighter orange). Low mean admissions rates tend to occur in a loose band extending from the Southwest through the South, Appalachia, and into parts of New England. All 12 states in the high mean admissions rate class sustained admissions declines, with 10 of those states having declines in the steepest category (states colored darkest blue). Consistent with prior research on medical marijuana and adolescent marijuana use, medical legalization status does not appear to correspond to treatment admission trends. Notably, however, 7 of 8 states with recreational legalization during the study period fall into the class with the steepest level of admissions decline.

At the same time, mainstream commercial pornography has coalesced around a relatively homogenous script involving violence and female degradation. Yet, little work has been done exploring the associations between pornography and dyadic sexual encounters: What role does pornography play inside real-world sexual encounters between a man and a woman? Cognitive script theory argues media scripts create a readily accessible heuristic model for decision-making. The more a user watches a particular media script, the more embedded those codes of behavior become in their worldview and the more likely they are to use those scripts to act upon real life experiences. We argue pornography creates a sexual script that then guides sexual experiences. To test this, we surveyed 487 college men (ages 1829 years) in the United States to compare their rate of pornography use with sexual preferences and concerns. Results showed the more pornography a man watches, the more likely he was to use it during sex, request particular pornographic sex acts of his partner, deliberately conjure images of pornography during sex to maintain arousal, and have concerns over his own sexual performance and body image. Further, higher pornography use was negatively associated with enjoying sexually intimate behaviors with a partner. We conclude that pornography provides a powerful heuristic model which is implicated in mens expectations and behaviors during sexual encounters.",Porn Use and Adolescent Health A Collaborative Review

We find evidence that social bots played a disproportionate role in spreading articles from low-credibility sources. Bots amplify such content in the early spreading moments, before an article goes viral. They also target users with many followers through replies and mentions. Humans are vulnerable to this manipulation, resharing content posted by bots. Successful low-credibility sources are heavily supported by social bots.

When a later cohort is compared to an earlier cohort, IQ trends vary dramatically by age. Piagetian trends indicate that a decimation of top scores may be accompanied by gains in cognitive ability below the median.

Here we study the conditions in which such echo chambers emerge by introducing a simple model of information sharing in online social networks with the two ingredients of influence and unfriending. Users can change both their opinions and social connections based on the information to which they are exposed through sharing. The model dynamics show that even with minimal amounts of influence and unfriending, the social network rapidly devolves into segregated, homogeneous communities. These predictions are consistent with empirical data from Twitter. Although our findings suggest that echo chambers are somewhat inevitable given the mechanisms at play in online social media, they also provide insights into possible mitigation strategies.",Social Media and Political Dysfunction

The present study experimentally examined the effects of reducing smartphone SMU on appearances and weight esteem in youth with emotional distress.

Baseline and post-intervention measurements were taken to assess changes in appearance and weight esteem. Compared to the controls, the intervention group yielded significant increases in both appearance ( p , .022) and weight esteem ( p , .026).

Few studies have examined national patterns and characteristics of EDs that these children present to. In data from the National Pediatric Readiness Project, it is reported that less than half of EDs are prepared to treat children. Our objective is to describe the trends in pediatric mental health visits to US EDs, with a focus on low-volume, nonmetropolitan EDs, which have been shown to be less prepared to provide pediatric emergency care. METHODS: Using 2007 to 2016 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample databases, we assessed the number of ED visits made by children (517 years) with a mental health disorder using descriptive statistics. ED characteristics included pediatric volume, childrens ED classification, and location. RESULTS: Pediatric ED visits have been stable; however, visits for deliberate self-harm increased 329%, and visits for all mental health disorders rose 60%. Visits for children with a substance use disorder rose 159%, whereas alcohol-related disorders fell 39%. These increased visits occurred among EDs of all pediatric volumes, regardless of childrens ED classification. Visits to low-pediatric-volume and nonmetropolitan areas rose 53% and 41%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although the total number of pediatric ED visits has remained stable, visits among children with mental health disorders have risen, particularly among youth presenting for deliberate self-harm and substance abuse. The majority of these visits occur at nonchildrens EDs in both metropolitan and nonurban settings, which have been shown to be less prepared to provide higher-level pediatric emergency care.",Adolescent mood disorders since 2010

However, the extent of the Internet's impact on adolescent sexual attitudes and behaviors is not yet known.A total of 433 adolescents completed an anonymous survey at a health center in New York City. The cross-sectional survey assessed Internet accessibility, exposure to sexually explicit Web sites (SEWs), sexual behaviors, and sexually permissive attitudes.Of the participants, 96% had Internet access, and 55.4% reported ever visiting a SEW. Logistic regression analyses revealed that adolescents exposed to SEWs were more likely to have multiple lifetime sexual partners (OR=1.8, CI=1.2, 2.9), to have had more than one sexual partner in the last 3 months (OR=1.8, CI=1.1, 3.1), to have used alcohol or other substances at last sexual encounter (OR=2.8, CI=1.5, 5.2), and to have engaged in anal sex (OR=2.0, CI=1.2, 3.4). Adolescents who visit SEWs display higher sexual permissiveness scores compared with those who have never been exposed (2.3 vs. 1.9, p <or= .001), indicating a more permissive attitude.Exposure to Internet pornography has potential implications for adolescent sexual relationships, such as number of partners and substance use. SEWs can serve an educational purpose and create an opportunity for adults to engage adolescents in discussions about sexual health and consumption of Internet material. Longitudinal research is needed to evaluate how exposure to SEWs influences youth attitudes and sexual behaviors.",Porn Use and Adolescent Health A Collaborative Review

(2016)",https://doi.org/10.2196/mental.5925,,"Background Adolescents and young adults are among the most frequent Internet users, and accumulating evidence suggests that their Internet behaviors might affect their mental health. Internet use may impact mental health because certain Web-based content could be distressing. It is also possible that excessive use, regardless of content, produces negative consequences, such as neglect of protective offline activities. Objective The objective of this study was to assess how mental health is associated with (1) the time spent on the Internet, (2) the time spent on different Web-based activities (social media use, gaming, gambling, pornography use, school work, newsreading, and targeted information searches), and (3) the perceived consequences of engaging in those activities. Methods A random sample of 2286 adolescents was recruited from state schools in Estonia, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Questionnaire data comprising Internet behaviors and mental health variables were collected and analyzed cross-sectionally and were followed up after 4 months. Results Cross-sectionally, both the time spent on the Internet and the relative time spent on various activities predicted mental health (P&lt;.001), explaining 1.4% and 2.8% variance, respectively. However, the consequences of engaging in those activities were more important predictors, explaining 11.1% variance. Only Web-based gaming, gambling, and targeted searches had mental health effects that were not fully accounted for by perceived consequences. The longitudinal analyses showed that sleep loss due to Internet use (=.12, 95% CI=0.05-0.19, P=.001) and withdrawal (negative mood) when Internet could not be accessed (=.09, 95% CI=0.03-0.16, P&lt;.01) were the only consequences that had a direct effect on mental health in the long term. Perceived positive consequences of Internet use did not seem to be associated with mental health at all. Conclusions The magnitude of Internet use is negatively associated with mental health in general, but specific Web-based activities differ in how consistently, how much, and in what direction they affect mental health. Consequences of Internet use (especially sleep loss and withdrawal when Internet cannot be accessed) seem to predict mental health outcomes to a greater extent than the specific activities themselves. Interventions aimed at reducing the negative mental health effects of Internet use could target its negative consequences instead of the Internet use itself.

The present study employed an experimental manipulation to examine the effects of an acute reduction of social media use over a one-week period to assess the potential causal role of social media use in anxiety and sleep quality.Baseline social media use across one week was captured via smartphones, in addition to questionnaire measures of anxiety and sleep quality in a group of 93 unselected participants (female = 48, male = 43, did not specify = 2). Participants were then randomly assigned to suspend social media use for one week, whilst the other half used social media as normal. At the end of this week participants returned for a second data collection session where the same measures were re-administered.No evidence of a causal effect of social media use on anxiety or sleep quality was observed.While capturing objective mobile social media data, future research could also benefit from incorporating usage data from computers and other devices.The discussion considers the possibility that the findings may represent the genuine absence of such a relationship versus the failure to detect an extant relationship and the importance of including objective measures of social media use.",Social Media and Mental Health

MethodsWe surveyed a nationally-representative sample of 1787 U.S. young adults ages 1932. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). We assessed use of multiple SM platforms with an adapted Pew Internet Research scale. We used ordered logistic regression models to assess associations between use of multiple SM platforms and mental health outcomes while controlling for eight covariates, including overall TSSM. ResultsCompared to those who used 02 social media platforms, participants who used 711 social media platforms had substantially higher odds of having increased levels of both depression (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]=3.0, 95% CI=1.94.8) and anxiety symptoms (AOR=3.2, 95% CI=2.05.1). Associations were linear (p<0.001 for all) and robust to all sensitivity analyses. ConclusionsUse of multiple SM platforms is independently associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety, even when controlling for overall TSSM. These associations are strong enough that it may be valuable for clinicians to ask individuals with depression and anxiety about multiple platform use and to counsel regarding this potential contributing factor. We found a linear association between the number of platforms used and depression.We found a linear association between the number of platforms used and anxiety.Associations remained strong after controlling for total time of social media use.",Social Media and Mental Health

The association of these changes with the use of mental health services has not been previously examined.   Objective   To examine national trends in the care of different mental health problems and in different treatment settings among adolescents.   Design, Setting, and Participants   Data for this survey study were drawn from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an annual cross-sectional survey of the US general population. This study focused on adolescent participants aged 12 to 17 years interviewed from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2018. Data were reported as weighted percentages and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and analyzed from July 20 to December 1, 2019.   Main Outcomes and Measures   Time trends in 12-month prevalence of any mental health treatment or counseling in a wide range of settings were examined overall and for different sociodemographic groups, types of mental health problems (internalizing, externalizing, relationship, and school related), and treatment settings (inpatient mental health, outpatient mental health, general medical, and school counseling). Trends in the number of visits and nights in inpatient settings were also examined.   Results   A total of 47090 of the 230070 adolescents across survey years (19.7%) received mental health care. Of these, 57.5% were female; 31.3%, aged 12 to 13 years; 35.8%, aged 14 to 15 years; and 32.9%, aged 16 to 17 years. The overall prevalence of mental health care did not change appreciably over time. However, mental health care increased among girls (from 22.8% in 2005-2006 to 25.4% in 2017-2018; aOR,1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.19;P=.001), non-Hispanic white adolescents (from 20.4% in 2005-2006 to 22.7% in 2017-2018; aOR,1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.14;P=.004), and those with private insurance (from 19.4% in 2005-2006 to 21.2% in 2017-2018; aOR,1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18;P=.002). Internalizing problems, including suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms, accounted for an increasing proportion of care (from 48.3% in 2005-2006 to 57.8% in 2017-2018; aOR,1.52; 95% CI,1.39-1.66;P   Conclusions and Relevance   This studys findings suggest that the growing number of adolescents who receive care for internalizing mental health problems and the increasing share who receive care in specialty outpatient settings are placing new demands on specialty adolescent mental health treatment resources.",Adolescent mood disorders since 2010

A Review with Clinical Reports,"Traditional factors that once explained men's sexual difficulties appear insufficient to account for the sharp rise in erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation, decreased sexual satisfaction, and diminished libido during partnered sex in men under 40. This review (1) considers data from multiple domains, e.g., clinical, biological (addiction/urology), psychological (sexual conditioning), sociological; and (2) presents a series of clinical reports, all with the aim of proposing a possible direction for future research of this phenomenon. Alterations to the brain's motivational system are explored as a possible etiology underlying pornography-related sexual dysfunctions. This review also considers evidence that Internet pornography's unique properties (limitless novelty, potential for easy escalation to more extreme material, video format, etc.) may be potent enough to condition sexual arousal to aspects of Internet pornography use that do not readily transition to real-life partners, such that sex with desired partners may not register as meeting expectations and arousal declines. Clinical reports suggest that terminating Internet pornography use is sometimes sufficient to reverse negative effects, underscoring the need for extensive investigation using methodologies that have subjects remove the variable of Internet pornography use. In the interim, a simple diagnostic protocol for assessing patients with porn-induced sexual dysfunction is put forth.",Porn Use and Adolescent Health A Collaborative Review

Searches of the published literature were conducted across 12 databases. No language restriction was applied.The analysis included randomized clinical trials, cohort studies, and cross-sectional study designs. Inclusion criteria were studies of school-age children between 6 and 19 years. Exclusion criteria were studies of stationary exposures, such as televisions or desktop or personal computers, or studies investigating electromagnetic radiation.Of 467 studies identified, 20 cross-sectional studies were assessed for methodological quality. Two reviewers independently extracted data.The primary outcomes were inadequate sleep quantity, poor sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness, studied according to an a priori protocol.Twenty studies were included, and their quality was assessed. The studies involved 125 198 children (mean [SD] age, 14.5 [2.2] years; 50.1% male). There was a strong and consistent association between bedtime media device use and inadequate sleep quantity (odds ratio [OR], 2.17; 95% CI, 1.42-3.32) (P < .001, I2 = 90%), poor sleep quality (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.14-1.88) (P = .003, I2 = 76%), and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.32-5.61) (P = .007, I2 = 50%).

Bedtime access to and use of a media device were significantly associated with the following: inadequate sleep quantity, poor sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness. An integrated approach among teachers, health care professionals, and parents is required to minimize device access at bedtime, and future research is needed to evaluate the influence of the devices on sleep hygiene and outcomes.",Social Media and Mental Health

Associations between technology use and negative correlates (e.g., depression and anxiety) remain common. However, pre-registered studies have failed to replicate these findings. Regardless of direction, many designs rely on psychometric scales that claim to define and quantify a construct associated with technology engagement. These often suggest clinical manifestations present as disorders or addictions. Given their importance for research integrity, we consider what these scales might be measuring. Across three studies, we observe that many psychometric scales align with a single, identical construct despite claims they capture something unique. We conclude that many technology measures appear to measure a similar, poorly defined construct that sometimes overlaps with pre-existing measures of well-being. Social scientists should critically consider how they proceed methodologically and conceptually when developing psychometric scales in this domain to ensure research findings sit on solid foundations.",Social Media and Mental Health

Secular gains in standing height (indicating improved nutrition and health care) were also investigated. Substantial gains in GA were apparent from the mid 1950s (test years) to the end 1960searly 1970s, followed by a decreasing gain rate and a complete stop from the mid 1990s. The gains seemed to be mainly caused by decreasing prevalence of low scorers. From the early 1970s, the secular gains in GA were almost exclusively driven by gains on the Raven-like test. However, even the means on this particular test stopped to increase after the mid to late 1990s. It is concluded that the Flynn effect may have come to an end in Norway. Height gains were strongly correlated with intelligence gains until the cessation of height gains in the conscript cohorts towards the end of the 1980s.

Recent scholarship on selective avoidance suggests that citizens when exposed to contentious stimuli tend to either neglect, avoid, or by-pass such content, a practice scholarly known as users' filtration tactics or unfriending. Drawing upon a nationally representative panel survey from the United States (W1 = 1338/W2 = 511) fielded in 2019/2020, this study seeks to a) examine whether social media news use is associated to exposure to uncivil political discussions, and 2) explore the ways in which both constructs causally affect users' unfriending behavior. Finally, the study investigates the contingent moderating role of uncivil political discussion in energizing the relationship between social media use for news and unfriending. Our findings first find support for the idea that social media news use directly activates citizens' uncivil discussions and unfriending, while uncivil political discussion directly triggers unfriending behavior and significantly contributes to intensify the effect of social media news use over citizens unfriending levels. These findings add to current conversations about the potential motivations and deleterious effects of social media filtering in contemporary democracies.",Social Media and Political Dysfunction

However, previous studies have not elucidated the specific importance of SM use immediately before bed. We aimed to determine the independent association of SM use during the 30 minutes before bed and disturbed sleep while controlling for covariates including total SM use throughout the day. Methods We assessed a nationally representative sample of 1763 US young adults aged 1932. Participants estimated to what extent they used SM in the 30 minutes before bed. We assessed sleep disturbance using the brief Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance measure. After testing the proportional odds assumption, we used ordered logistic regression to compute the independent association between SM use before bed and sleep disturbance controlling for covariates, including total SM use. Results Compared with those who rarely or very rarely check SM in the 30 minutes before bed, those who often or very often check SM at that time had an adjusted odds ratio of 1.62 (95% confidence interval = 1.312.34) for increased sleep disturbance. Additionally, we found a significant linear trend in the odds ratios between the frequency of checking SM in the 30 minutes before bed and increased sleep disturbance (p = .007).

Yet empirical evidence about how social media shapes information consumption is inconclusive. We articulate how characteristics of platform algorithms and users online social networks may combine to shape user behavior. We bring greater conceptual clarity to this phenomenon by expanding beyond discussion of a binary presence or absence of echo chambers and filter bubbles to a richer set of outcomes incorporating changes in both diversity and slant of users information sources. Using a data set with over four years of web browsing history for a representative panel of nearly 200,000 U.S. adults, we analyzed how individuals social media usage was associated with changes in the information sources they chose to consume.

A cross-sectional school-based survey of 10,930 adolescents (5211 males/5719 females), aged 1417 years old (mean age 15.8  0.7) was carried out in six European countries (Greece, Spain, Poland, Romania, the Netherlands, and Iceland). Anonymous self-completed questionnaires covered exposure to pornography, internet use and dysfunctional internet behavior, and psychopathological syndromes (measured by Achenbachs Youth Self-Report). The prevalence of any online exposure to pornography was 59% overall and 24% for exposure at least once a week. The likelihood of online exposure to pornography was greater in male adolescents, heavier internet users, and those who displayed dysfunctional internet behavior. Country-specific analyses confirmed that the gender effect existed in every country, although its strength varied, from an odds ratio of 1.88 in Poland to 14.9 in Greece. Online exposure to pornography was shown to be associated with externalizing problem scale scores, especially rule-breaking and aggressive behavior, but also associated with higher scores in competences, namely activities and social competence. Exposure to pornography is ubiquitous, more relevant to boys, and is associated with both positive qualities/competences and externalizing behavioral problems.",Porn Use and Adolescent Health A Collaborative Review

Fixed effects regression helps ensure that observed effects are not due to individual differences. Results indicate that social media use had a small but significant influence on misperceptions about President Obama in the 2012 election, and that this effect was most pronounced among strong partisans. Social media had no effect on belief accuracy about the Republican candidate in that election. The 2016 survey focused on campaign issues. There is no evidence that social media use influenced belief accuracy about these topics in aggregate, but Facebook users were unique. Social media use by this group reduced issue misperceptions relative to those who only used other social media.

One of the most puzzling phenomena regarding mental health treatment, research, and policy is why depression has become the central component of the stress tradition since then.This article reviews statistical trends in diagnosis, treatment, drug prescriptions, and textual readings of diagnostic criteria and secondary literature.The association of anxiety with diffuse and amorphous conceptions of ""stress"" and ""neuroses"" became incompatible with professional norms demanding diagnostic specificity. At the same time, the contrasting nosologies of anxiety and depression in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III (DSM-III) extended major depressive disorder to encompass far more patients than any particular anxiety disorder. In addition, antidepressant drugs were not associated with the stigma and alleged side effects of the anxiolytic drugs.Various factors combined between the 1970s and the 1990s to transform conditions that had been viewed as ""anxiety"" into ""depression."" New interests in the twenty-first century, however, might lead to the reemergence of anxiety as the signature mental health problem of American society.",Alternative Hypotheses to the Adolescent Mental Illness Crisis A Collaborative Review

We investigate this question across five studies (total N = 1,364). First, we demonstrate that people hold distinct mindsets about the amount of agency they have over their social media use (in control vs. out of control) and the valence of its effects in their lives (enhancing vs. harmful) (Studies 1-2). We develop and validate a 12-item instrument, the Social Media Mindsets scale (SMMS) to assess these mindsets systematically. We show that social media mindsets differentially relate to diverse indicators of psychological well-being, explaining more variance in psychological distress and perceived social support than time spent on social media (Studies 2-3). People who hold more agentic, positive mindsets (i.e., that social media can be leveraged to fulfill needs) consistently experience greater well-being than those with a low-agency, negative mindset (i.e., that social media is addictive). This effect operates through two routes: appraisal effects and behavioral change. Holding a more agentic mindset not only changes how people use social media, but also how they remember and understand its role in their lives (Study 4). Finally, we experimentally manipulate social media mindsets through a targeted intervention, which reduced depression and increased social connection among the treatment group (Study 5). We discuss implications for social media effects on well-being, the study of mindsets in relation to technology, and for practical interventions for improving experiences with social media.",Social Media and Mental Health

A cross-temporal meta-analysis (20012015),"Abstract     Generational IQ test score changes (i.e., the Flynn effect) have been shown to affect most measures of cognitive ability, although certain domains appear to be impervious. Because IQ test score changes have been found to differ between domains, evidence for specific domains is warranted to explain the nature, meaning, and causes of the Flynn effect. In the present cross-temporal meta-analysis, we investigated potential test score changes over time for ability emotional intelligence as assessed with a widely-used measure (i.e., the MSCEIT V2.0) based on data from 160 samples ( N =16,738) from English-speaking countries over a time-span of 15years (20012015). We found no evidence for substantial generational test score changes in overall or branch (i.e., subscale) ability emotional IQ scores. Consistent with our expectations, test performance was substantially higher for women in most measures. Contrary to our expectations though, average performance of our participants was considerably lower than the performance of normative samples on all scales, thus raising concerns about the appropriateness of the current norms. In all, we argue that ability emotional IQ as measured with the MSCEIT V2.0 is largely unaffected by typical causes that have been proposed as responsible for the Flynn effect. This may be due to the close association of this construct with psychometric   g   (associations of MSCEIT V2.0 scores with cognitive task performance were modest in our data) on one hand and personality traits on the other hand, both of which have been shown not to be associated with test score gains.",Changes in Cognitive Ability A Review

Many studies have examined the high prevalence of FA in this clinical population; however, less is known about its clinical significance and relationship to the individual psychological distress of parents. In our study, we investigated the clinical significance of FA examining its relationship with obsessive-compulsive symptomatology, functioning, anxiety and depressive symptoms in a clinical sample (n=51) of children and adolescents with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) aged 817years old and their parents, included to examine their individual psychological distress. Methods The sample was divided into two groups: the High Accommodation group (n=36) and the Low Accommodation group (n=15). Results Results demonstrated that children and adolescents in the OCD High Accommodation group reported major functional impairment in global (p=.001313), social (p=.000334) and role (p=.000334) domains, and higher depressive symptoms than the Low Accommodation group. Both fathers and mothers from the High Accommodation group reported a higher level of individual psychological distress compared to mothers and fathers from the Low Accommodation group (p=.040365). Conclusions The findings of this study show that FA is common in children and adolescents with OCD and it could cause not only an impairment of the patients global, social and role functioning but also a high level of individual psychological distress in the single parent.

The first set of misconceptions concerns the prevalence and circulation of misinformation. First, scientists focus on social media because it is methodologically convenient, but misinformation is not just a social media problem. Second, the internet is not rife with misinformation or news, but with memes and entertaining content. Third, falsehoods do not spread faster than the truth; how we define (mis)information influences our results and their practical implications. The second set of misconceptions concerns the impact and the reception of misinformation. Fourth, people do not believe everything they see on the internet: the sheer volume of engagement should not be conflated with belief. Fifth, people are more likely to be uninformed than misinformed; surveys overestimate misperceptions and say little about the causal influence of misinformation.

However, longitudinal studies are lacking.To repeatedly measure the association between screen time and depression to test 3 explanatory hypotheses: displacement, upward social comparison, and reinforcing spirals.This secondary analysis used data from a randomized clinical trial assessing the 4-year efficacy of a personality-targeted drug and alcohol prevention intervention. This study assessed screen time and depression throughout 4 years, using an annual survey in a sample of adolescents who entered the seventh grade in 31 schools in the Greater Montreal area. Data were collected from September 2012 to September 2018. Analysis began and ended in December 2018.Independent variables were social media, television, video gaming, and computer use. Symptoms of depression was the outcome, measured using the Brief Symptoms Inventory. Exercise and self-esteem were assessed to test displacement and upward social comparison hypothesis.A total of 3826 adolescents (1798 girls [47%]; mean [SD] age, 12.7 [0.5] years) were included. In general, depression symptoms increased yearly (year 1 mean [SD], 4.29 [5.10] points; year 4 mean [SD], 5.45 [5.93] points). Multilevel models, which included random intercepts at the school and individual level estimated between-person and within-person associations between screen time and depression. Significant between-person associations showed that for every increased hour spent using social media, adolescents showed a 0.64-unit increase in depressive symptoms (95% CI, 0.32-0.51). Similar between-level associations were reported for computer use (0.69; 95% CI, 0.47-0.91). Significant within-person associations revealed that a further 1-hour increase in social media use in a given year was associated with a further 0.41-unit increase in depressive symptoms in that same year. A similar within-person association was found for television (0.18; 95% CI, 0.09-0.27). Significant between-person and within-person associations between screen time and exercise and self-esteem supported upward social comparison and not displacement hypothesis. Furthermore, a significant interaction between the between-person and within-person associations concerning social media and self-esteem supported reinforcing spirals hypothesis.Time-varying associations between social media, television, and depression were found, which appeared to be more explained by upward social comparison and reinforcing spirals hypotheses than by the displacement hypothesis.

Greater parental accommodation and associated interference were associated with higher maternal distress. Among the anxiety disorders, accommodation was most strongly associated with generalized and separation anxiety disorder, as well as specific phobias.

It has been theorized that SCGs could be a gateway to gambling activities or otherwise normalize the experience of gambling for young people, particularly when money becomes involved. The aim of this study was to investigate whether adolescents financial expenditure in SCGs was associated with broader gambling activity, including level of participation, expenditure, and problem gambling symptoms. Methods An online survey was administered to 555 adolescents, including 130 SCG players (78 non-paying and 52 paying users). Results Paying SCG users tended to be employed males who play more frequently and engage in more SCG activities, who report more symptoms of problem gambling and higher psychological distress than non-paying SCG users. Paying SCG users reported more frequent engagement and spending in monetary gambling activities, and two-thirds of SCG payers recalled that their SCG use had preceded involvement in financial gambling. Discussion and conclusions Spending in simulated gambling activities by adolescents may be a risk factor for problem gambling. Although SCGs may currently defy classification as a form of gambling, these activities will likely continue to be scrutinized by regulators for the use of dubious or exploitative payment features offered in a gambling-themed format that is available to persons of all ages.",Digital Gambling and Adolescent Health A Collaborative Review

Re-examining the Confluence Model with third variable considerations,"The Confluence Model of sexual aggression (Malamuth, Addison, & Koss, 2000) states that pornography use, thought to promote sexual coercion of women through presentation of submissive female imagery, works in conjunction with sexual promiscuity (SP) and hostile masculinity (HM), proposed sexual aggression risk factors, to produce anti-woman sexual aggression. An Internet based survey (N=183 adult males) replicated results of previous Confluence Model research, such that men who were high in HM and SP were more likely to report sexual coercion when they frequently, rather than infrequently, used pornography. Exploring new ground, this study also found that HM and SP together were strong predictors of consumption of violent sexual media, in comparison to non-violent sexual media, which suggests that men at high risk of sexual aggression consume different types of sexual material than men at low risk. Further, individual differences in sex drive were found to account for the effects previously attributed to pornography use in statistical tests of the Confluence Model.

Results: The younger group spent significantly more time on social media use than the older group. It had significantly higher levels of daily stress, problematic social media use, depression and anxiety symptoms, and suicide-related outcomes. The older group showed significantly higher levels of positive mental health. Only in the younger group, problematic social media use significantly mediated the relationship between daily stress and suicide-related outcomes in a moderated mediation analysis. Positive mental health significantly moderated the association between problematic social media use and suicide-related outcomes. Specifically, the higher the positive mental health level, the less close the link between both variables. Conclusion: The current results reveal that young women in Russia could be at enhanced risk for daily stress, problematic social media use, and low levels of mental health. The interaction between these variables could foster suicide-related outcomes.

Here, we apply the reinforcing spirals model to examine whether, and how, social media news use shapes populist attitudes over time. Specifically, we assess if using social media as a news source serves to maintain existing populist attitudes or facilitates a shift in attitudes to a more extreme position. A cross-sectional survey (N 1=195) highlighted a positive correlation between social media news use and populist attitudes. A four-wave longitudinal survey (N 2=386) further showed that this relationship reflects media and selection effects. Over a period of three months, more frequent social media news use predicted stronger populist attitudes at subsequent measuring points. In addition, higher levels of populist attitudes were related to more frequent social media news consumption in the following waves. However, the frequency of social media news use did not change over time and populist attitudes did not become stronger during the study period. Taken together, the findings indicate that social media news use contributed to the maintenance of populist attitudes at a stable level. There is no evidence to suggest social media news use predicted more extreme populist attitudes. We discuss these results with respect to the (potentially continued) rise of populism; we also critically reflect on the phenomenon of attitude polarization online.",Social Media and Political Dysfunction

Social media interaction was assessed through daily frequency of chatting on social websites. Well-being was measured by happiness with six domains of life and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Findings suggest gender differences in the relationship between interacting on social media and well-being. There were significant correlations between interacting on social media and well-being intercepts and between social media interaction and well-being slopes among females. Additionally higher social media interaction at age 10 was associated with declines in well-being thereafter for females, but not for males. Results were similar for both measures of well-being. High levels of social media interaction in early adolescence have implications for well-being in later adolescence, particularly for females. The lack of an association among males suggests other factors might be associated with their reduction in well-being with age. These findings contribute to the debate on causality and may inform future policy and interventions.",Social Media and Mental Health

This article builds on systemic approaches to deliberative democracy to characterize key vulnerabilities of social media platforms that disinformation actors exploit, and to clarify potential anti-deliberative effects of disinformation. The disinformation campaigns mounted by Russian agents around the United States 2016 election illustrate the use of anti-deliberative tactics, including corrosive falsehoods, moral denigration, and unjustified inclusion. We further propose that these tactics might contribute to the system-level anti-deliberative properties of epistemic cynicism, techno-affective polarization, and pervasive inauthenticity. These harms undermine a politys capacity to engage in communication characterized by the use of facts and logic, moral respect, and democratic inclusion. Clarifying which democratic goods are at risk from disinformation, and how they are put at risk, can help identify policies that go beyond targeting the architects of disinformation campaigns to address structural vulnerabilities in deliberative systems.",Social Media and Political Dysfunction

Currently, the role of chronotype in these associations is understudied. To address these gaps, this study examined how different uses of screen media are linked to sleep, and whether these associations were accounted for or differed across chronotype.       Methods   Data were from 11,361 children aged 13 to 15 from the United Kingdom who participated in the 2015 wave of the Millennium Cohort Study.       Results   Heavy use of screen media was associated with shorter sleep duration, longer sleep latency, and more mid-sleep awakenings. The strongest associations emerged for using screen media to engage in social media or to use the internet. Overall, these associations were weakened, but remained after controlling for chronotype and tended to be the strongest amongst robins (children with an intermediate chronotype).       Conclusions   Spending too much time on electronic devices is associated with multiple dimensions of impaired sleep, especially if this time on devices is used for social media or surfing the internet. Chronotype does not account for the associations between screen media and sleep and can be used to identify children who may be particularly susceptible to the effects of screen media on sleep.",Social Media and Mental Health

We found that, although there were no direct effects of social media use, social media indirectly contributed to polarization through increased political engagement. Those who actively used social network sites were more likely to engage in political processes, which led them to develop more extreme political attitudes over time than those who did not use social network sites. In particular, we observed a clear trend toward a more liberal direction among both politically INCONCLUSIVE users and moderately liberal users. In this study, we highlight the role of social media in activating political participation, which eventually pushes the users toward the ideological poles.

The present study assessed the association between the amount of time spent playing video games and children mental health as well as cognitive and social skills. Data were drawn from the School Children Mental Health Europe project conducted in six European Union countries (youth ages 611, n = 3195). Child mental health was assessed by parents and teachers using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and by children themselves with the Dominic Interactive. Child video game usage was reported by the parents. Teachers evaluated academic functioning. Multivariable logistic regressions were used. 20 % of the children played video games more than 5 h per week. Factors associated with time spent playing video games included being a boy, being older, and belonging to a medium size family. Having a less educated, single, inactive, or psychologically distressed mother decreased time spent playing video games. Children living in Western European countries were significantly less likely to have high video game usage (9.66 vs 20.49 %) though this was not homogenous. Once adjusted for child age and gender, number of children, mothers age, marital status, education, employment status, psychological distress, and region, high usage was associated with 1.75 times the odds of high intellectual functioning (95 % CI 1.312.33), and 1.88 times the odds of high overall school competence (95 % CI 1.442.47). Once controlled for high usage predictors, there were no significant associations with any child self-reported or mother- or teacher-reported mental health problems. High usage was associated with decreases in peer relationship problems [OR 0.41 (0.20.86) and in prosocial deficits (0.23 (0.07, 0.81)]. Playing video games may have positive effects on young children. Understanding the mechanisms through which video game use may stimulate children should be further investigated.",Video Game Use and Adolescent Health A Collaborative Review

However, many children perceive smartphones as a key barrier for engaging in physical activity during recess. The aim was to investigate if a ban on smartphone usage during recess changed childrens physical activity. During AugustOctober 2020, children from grades 47 (1014 years) at six Danish schools were banned from using their smartphones during recess for a four-week period. Questionnaire and systematic observation (SOPLAY) data were collected from 814 children before intervention (baseline) and 828 during the last week of intervention (follow-up). The mean frequency of physical activity significantly increased from baseline to follow-up (odds ratio = 1.370), as did physical activity on a moderate level (odds ratio = 1.387). Vigorous physical activity significantly decreased (odds ratio = 0.851). The increase in physical activity was found among both schools having outdoor and indoor recess, among both boys and girls, and nearly equally among grades 47. This suggests that implementing a ban on smartphone usage during recess would improve the everyday conditions for health among a broad range of schoolchildren.

Regression and decomposition techniques are used to investigate the role of school stress for trends in psychosomatic symptoms, and for gender differences in symptoms. Results show that the effects of school stress on psychosomatic symptoms have become stronger over time, but that they can only account for a small share of the overall increase in symptoms since 1993. However, school stress has increased more among girls than among boys, and it explains about half of the growth of the gender gap in symptoms. Thus, school stress accounts for a substantial portion of the increase in symptoms for girls, but only a minor share of the increase for boys. In sum, we found weak evidence for the educational stressors hypothesis in regard to the overall trend in symptoms, but strong evidence for it in explaining the growing gender gap.",Alternative Hypotheses to the Adolescent Mental Illness Crisis A Collaborative Review

Results did not support this prediction, nor did they support the idea that the relationship between these factors follows a nonlinear parabolic function.

Prior work has shown that choosing what is popular may amplify random fluctuations and lead to sub-optimal rankings. Nonetheless, it is often assumed that recommending what is popular will help high-quality content bubble up in practice. Here we identify the conditions in which popularity may be a viable proxy for quality content by studying a simple model of a cultural market endowed with an intrinsic notion of quality. A parameter representing the cognitive cost of exploration controls the trade-off between quality and popularity. Below and above a critical exploration cost, popularity bias is more likely to hinder quality. But we find a narrow intermediate regime of user attention where an optimal balance exists: choosing what is popular can help promote high-quality items to the top.

Regression models were calculated for each lifestyle variable, with mental health change from ages 7 to 14 years as the exposure variable. Data were weighted to account for the potential clustering of region of sampling and adjusted for nonresponse. Results A total of 9369 participants were included in waves 4 and 6 of the Millennium Cohort Study, including 4665 (48.1%) girls and 6014 participants (81.9%) who were born in England. Adolescents who self-reported mental health problems at age 14 years only were less likely to have at least 9 hours of sleep (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.34-0.45) and to consume fruit (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.46-0.65) and vegetables (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52-0.83) reported greater use of social media (<i>b</i> = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49-0.75) compared with individuals who did not have mental health problems at both time points. Similarly, those with mental health problems at both time points were less likely to achieve 9 hours sleep (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51-0.90), consume fruit (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.26-0.58) and vegetables (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.35-0.91), and reported greater social media use (<i>b</i> = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.34-0.91). Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that the presence of depressive symptoms at ages 7 and 14 years and at age 14 years only were associated with some health behaviors in adolescence. These findings are particularly important given that independent health behaviors can deteriorate and become habitual during adolescence, and adolescence is a known time for the first emergence of mental health problems that continue into adulthood.",Social Media and Mental Health

Most of the sample was female (51.0%), non-Hispanic white (58.8%), and in grade 8 (52.2%); mean age: 14.60 years (95% CI: 14.57, 14.64). We subsequently examined differences in depressive and other internalizing symptoms between these time use groups over time with survey-weighted logistic regressions producing odds ratios.Analyses derived six groups: part time workers, full time workers, and four groups based on levels of social activities (Low, medium, and high levels, with ""High Social"" split between those engaged in sports, academics, and community service and those who were not). Internalizing symptoms were predicted by lower socialization, low engagement in activities like sports, academics, and community service, and time spent at a paid job. Adolescents decreasingly engaged in social activities over time, though shifts in time use patterns did not account for much of the overall increase in depressive symptoms.Shifts in adolescent time use do not explain increases in depressive and other internalizing symptoms, which increased across different patterns of time use. Levels of internalizing symptoms were highest among those with low socialization, low recreational engagement, and those working substantial hours. Encouraging socialization, engagement in recreational activities, and providing mental health resources for isolated adolescents may reduce internalizing symptom trends.",Adolescent mood disorders since 2010

Explanations have implicated digital media, with the so-called echo chamber remaining a dominant causal hypothesis despite growing challenge by empirical evidence. This paper suggests that this mounting evidence provides not only reason to reject the echo chamber hypothesis but also the foundation for an alternative causal mechanism. To propose such a mechanism, the paper draws on the literatures on affective polarization, digital media, and opinion dynamics. From the affective polarization literature, we follow the move from seeing polarization as diverging issue positions to rooted in sorting: an alignment of differences which is effectively dividing the electorate into two increasingly homogeneous megaparties. To explain the rise in sorting, the paper draws on opinion dynamics and digital media research to present a model which essentially turns the echo chamber on its head: it is not isolation from opposing views that drives polarization but precisely the fact that digital media bring us to interact outside our local bubble. When individuals interact locally, the outcome is a stable plural patchwork of cross-cutting conflicts. By encouraging nonlocal interaction, digital media drive an alignment of conflicts along partisan lines, thus effacing the counterbalancing effects of local heterogeneity. The result is polarization, even if individual interaction leads to convergence. The model thus suggests that digital media polarize through partisan sorting, creating a maelstrom in which more and more identities, beliefs, and cultural preferences become drawn into an all-encompassing societal division.",Social Media and Political Dysfunction

The current study adds to the literature by investigating how passive use relates to these outcomes through social comparison and FoMO. For an ethnically diverse sample of college students (N = 717, Mage = 21.47, SDage = 4.64, 69% female), passively using SNSs positively predicted social comparison, which was positively related to FoMO, which in turn positively predicted depressive symptoms, and negatively predicted global self-worth, self-perceived physical appearance, and self-perceived social acceptance. These findings suggest that social comparison and FoMO play a role in the link between passive SNS use, depressive symptoms, and self-perceptions, and that FoMO could result from online social comparison.",Social Media and Mental Health

Adolescents also completed sociometric nominations of popularity. Consistent with hypotheses, technology-based social comparison and feedback-seeking were associated with depressive symptoms. Popularity and gender served as moderators of this effect, such that the association was particularly strong among females and adolescents low in popularity. Associations were found above and beyond the effects of overall frequency of technology use, offline excessive reassurance-seeking, and prior depressive symptoms.

This evolution in news diffusion comes at a time when Americans report increased affective partisan polarization. In particular, evidence shows increasingly negative attitudes about out-party members. Based on selective exposure and reinforcing spirals model perspectives, we examined the reciprocal relationship between Facebook news use and polarization using national 3-wave panel data collected during the 2016 US Presidential Election. Over the course of the campaign, we found media use and attitudes remained relatively stable. Our results also showed that Facebook news use was related to a modest over-time spiral of depolarization. Furthermore, we found that people who use Facebook for news were more likely to view both pro- and counter-attitudinal news in each wave. Our results indicated that counter-attitudinal news exposure increased over time, which resulted in depolarization. We found no evidence of a parallel model, where pro-attitudinal exposure stemming from Facebook news use resulted in greater affective polarization.",Social Media and Political Dysfunction

We partitioned students into depression risk quintiles to control for confounding due to underlying depression risk and examine heterogeneity in the association between social media use and depressive symptoms. Sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of results with different configurations of the predicted score model, and overall associations were examined in two-year groups to identify differences in effects.For girls, in adjusted risk-stratified analysis, daily social media use was not associated with high (vs. low) depressive symptoms. For boys, results were inconsistent, suggesting a protective effect of daily social media use at some cut scores.

Results indicate that while populist alternative news outlets drew more interest during the first-order election campaign, they reached only 16.5% of users even then. Moreover, most users visited their websites rather seldom. Nonetheless, our data suggest that alternative news exposure is strongly linked to voting for (right-wing) populist parties. Regarding the origins of exposure, our analyses punctuate the role of platforms in referring users to populist alternative news. About 40% of website visits originated from Facebook alone in both data sets and another third of visits from search engines.

We examined trends in emergency and inpatient encounters for SI and SA at US childrens hospitals from 2008 to 2015. METHODS: We used retrospective analysis of administrative billing data from the Pediatric Health Information System database. RESULTS: There were 115856 SI and SA encounters during the study period. Annual percentage of all visits for SI and SA almost doubled, increasing from 0.66% in 2008 to 1.82% in 2015 (average annual increase 0.16 percentage points [95% confidence intervals (CIs) 0.15 to 0.17]). Significant increases were noted in all age groups but were higher in adolescents 15 to 17 years old (average annual increase 0.27 percentage points [95% CI 0.23 to 0.30]) and adolescents 12 to 14 years old (average annual increase 0.25 percentage points [95% CI 0.21 to 0.27]). Increases were noted in girls (average annual increase 0.14 percentage points [95% CI 0.13 to 0.15]) and boys (average annual increase 0.10 percentage points [95% CI 0.09 to 0.11]), but were higher for girls. Seasonal variation was also observed, with the lowest percentage of cases occurring during the summer and the highest during spring and fall. CONCLUSIONS: Encounters for SI and SA at US childrens hospitals increased steadily from 2008 to 2015 and accounted for an increasing percentage of all hospital encounters. Increases were noted across all age groups, with consistent seasonal patterns that persisted over the study period. The growing impact of pediatric mental health disorders has important implications for childrens hospitals and health care delivery systems.",Adolescent mood disorders since 2010

Healthy People 2020 set a goal to reduce by 10% the rate of suicide attempts that required treatment and designated the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) to measure this objective. Objectives This study used cross-sectional YRBS data (20092017) to (a) investigate whether gender moderates the linear time trend for the rate of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts among high school students within the United States; (b) estimate these same measures stratified by gender; and (c) investigate whether the Healthy People 2020 goal for reduction in suicide attempts was met in 2017 for males and females. Methods Secondary analysis of nationally representative high school students using YRBS data 20092017 were analyzed using R and the R survey package. Based on Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines (STROBE), additive interactions using rate difference were compared to multiplicative interactions using odds ratios. Results Additive interactions were identified between female gender and linear trends for depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts requiring treatment. Females, but not males, had positive linear trends for depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts requiring treatment. Suicide attempts requiring treatment among females was 36% higher in 2017 than in 2009 but decreased 13% in males during the same period. Discussion The Healthy People 2020 goal to reduce suicide attempts requiring treatment by 10% has not been met among females.

Prolonged screen time and insufficient physical activity appear to operate independently and synergistically to increase the risk of poor mental wellbeing in school-aged children. We aimed to examine the gender-stratified dose-dependent and joint associations of screen time and physical activity with mental wellbeing in adolescents. Methods We used data from three rounds of Health Behaviour in School-aged Children cross-sectional surveys (2006, 2010, and 2014) from 42 European and North American countries. Survey participants, aged 11 years, 13 years, and 15 years, provided self-reported information by completing an anonymous questionnaire that included items on health indicators and related behaviours. We used the self-reported variables of life satisfaction and psychosomatic complaints as indicators of adolescents' mental wellbeing, combining these with the self-reported discretionary use of screens and engagement in physical activity. We used generalised additive models and multilevel regression modelling to examine the gender-stratified relationships between mental wellbeing and screen time and physical activity. Findings Our sample included 577 475 adolescents (mean age 13·60 years, SD 1·64), with 296 542 (51·35%) girls and 280 933 (48·64%) boys. The mean reported life satisfaction score (on a scale of 010) was 7·70 (95% CI 7·697·71) in boys and 7·48 (7·467·50) in girls. Psychosomatic complaints were more common among girls (mean 9·26, 95% CI 9·239·28) than boys (6·89, 6·876·91). Generalised additive model analyses showed slightly non-linear associations of screen time and physical activity with life satisfaction and psychosomatic complaints for girls and boys. Detrimental associations between screen time and mental wellbeing started when screen time exceeded 1 h per day, whereas increases in physical activity levels were beneficially and monotonically associated with wellbeing. Multilevel modelling showed that screen time levels were negatively associated with life satisfaction and positively associated with psychosomatic complaints in a dose-dependent manner. Physical activity levels were positively associated with life satisfaction and negatively associated with psychosomatic complaints in a dose-dependent manner. Joint associations of screen timephysical activity with mental wellbeing showed that, compared with the least active participants with more than 8 h per day of screen time and no physical activity, most of the other screen timephysical activity groups had considerably higher life satisfaction and lower psychosomatic complaints. Interpretation Higher levels of screen time and lower levels of physical activity were associated with lower life satisfaction and higher psychosomatic complaints among adolescents from high-income countries.

Objective: The objective of this study was to obtain a deeper insight in the nature of students� use of smartphones, as well as their attitudes towards educational use of mobile devices in order to design successful teaching interventions. Method: A questionnaire was designed, aiming to investigate the actual daily habitual use, as well as the attitudes of dental students towards smartphones for their university education purposes. The survey was used to collect data from 232 dental students. Results: Of the 232 respondents, 204 (87.9%) owned a smartphone, and 191 (82.3%) had access to third generation (3G) mobile carriers. The most popular devices were the iPhone and Android. Most of the respondents had intermediate smartphone skills and used smartphones for a number of learning activities. Only 75/232 (32.3%) had specific educational applications installed, while 148/232 (63.7%) used smartphones to access to social media and found it valuable for their education (P<.05). Students accessing social media with their smartphones also showed significantly more advanced skills with smartphones than those who did not (P<.05). There was no significant association between age group, gender, origin, and smartphone skills.

Across these studies, parenting accounted for only 4% of the variance in child anxiety. Moderator tests indicated that methodological factors (i.e., how child anxiety and parenting were conceptualized and assessed) may be a source of inconsistent findings within the literature. In addition, our analyses revealed that parental control was more strongly associated with child anxiety than was parental rejection. Specific subdimensions within parental rejection and control differed in their association with child anxiety (e.g., autonomy-granting accounted for 18% of the variance, but warmth <1%), indicating that efforts to disaggregate parenting dimensions may inform theory development and future research.

Here, we review evidence that expressions of moral emotion play an important role in the spread of moralized content (a phenomenon we call moral contagion). Next, we propose a psychological model called the motivation, attention, and design (MAD) model to explain moral contagion. The MAD model posits that people have group-identity-based motivations to share moral-emotional content, that such content is especially likely to capture our attention, and that the design of social-media platforms amplifies our natural motivational and cognitive tendencies to spread such content.

Among a sample of 325 iPhone users, we found that (a) participants misestimated their weekly overall iPhone and SM use by 19.1 and 12.2 hours, respectively; (b) correlations between estimated use and well-being variables were consistently stronger than the correlations between reported actual use and well-being variables; and (c) the degree of inaccuracy in estimated use was associated with levels of participant well-being and amount of use. These findings suggest that retrospective estimates of digital technology use may be systematically biased by factors that are fundamental to the associations under investigation. We propose that retrospective estimates of digital technology use may be capturing the construct of perceived use rather than actual use, and discuss how the antecedents, correlates, and consequences of perceived use may be distinct from those of actual use.

Recent evidence has highlighted the importance of outdoor play and the childcare environment. Active outdoor play, especially free play, supports independence, self-regulation and allows children to explore their world and make decisions. Loose parts or open-ended materials are natural or synthetic resources that can be used in more than one way, allowing children to experiment through play. Incorporating loose parts into play environments creates opportunity for new play experiences. Despite growing evidence supporting loose parts play, the perspectives of childcare providers on the benefits and challenges of this type of play have been overlooked. The purpose of this study was to identify the benefits and challenges of incorporating loose parts play into the outdoor environments of childcare centres, from the perspectives of educators who took part in the Physical Literacy in the Early Years (PLEY) project. PLEY is a larger, mixed methods intervention study with the goal of evaluating a loose parts intervention in early childcare settings. This portion of the project used qualitative description to explore educators perspectives. Data were collected using focus groups (n = 15) with early childhood educators (n = 35 in each group). Thematic analysis was used to identify five themes relating to benefits, and four themes relating to challenges. Benefit themes included: loose parts enable children to take risks; loose parts spark creativity and imagination; loose parts contribute to problem-solving abilities; loose parts cultivate independence and confidence; and loose parts build relationships and leadership. Challenges included: apprehension of loose parts; loose parts as a novelty; sustainability of loose parts; and loose parts present challenges with storage. Overall, we found educators perceived outdoor loose parts play to have multiple social and cognitive benefits for preschool-aged children that are critical for optimal growth and development, and overall health and wellness.",Free Play and Mental Health Collaborative Review

Concern has been raised that this increased accessibility may lead to a rise in pornography seeking among children and adolescents, with potentially serious ramifications for child and adolescent sexual development. Using data from the Youth Internet Safety Survey, a nationally representative, cross-sectional telephone survey of 1501 children and adolescents (ages 10-17 years), characteristics associated with self-reported pornography seeking behavior, both on the Internet and using traditional methods (e.g., magazines), are identified. Seekers of pornography, both online and offline, are significantly more likely to be male, with only 5% of self-identified seekers being female. The vast majority (87%) of youth who report looking for sexual images online are 14 years of age or older, when it is developmentally appropriate to be sexually curious. Children under the age of 14 who have intentionally looked at pornography are more likely to report traditional exposures, such as magazines or movies. Concerns about a large group of young children exposing themselves to pornography on the Internet may be overstated. Those who report intentional exposure to pornography, irrespective of source, are significantly more likely to cross-sectionally report delinquent behavior and substance use in the previous year. Further, online seekers versus offline seekers are more likely to report clinical features associated with depression and lower levels of emotional bonding with their caregiver. Results of the current investigation raise important questions for further inquiry. Findings from these cross-sectional data provide justification for longitudinal studies aimed at parsing out temporal sequencing of psychosocial experiences.",Porn Use and Adolescent Health A Collaborative Review

Here, we evaluated whether a subchronic low dose of a glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) could induce alterations in the central nervous system, using the flavonoid quercetin as a therapeutic strategy. Forty mice were divided into four treatment groups: control, GBH, quercetin, and GBH+Quer groups and received 50 mg/kg of GBH solution, 30 mg/kg of quercetin, and/or vehicles for 30 days via gavage. After performing behavioral tests, such as the open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM), forced swim test (FST), and sucrose preference test (SPT), the mice were euthanized and their hippocampal tissues were collected to measure the levels of oxidative stress markers such as reactive species (RS), total antioxidant capacity (FRAP), reduced glutathione (GSH), and acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE), as well as for histological evaluation. The GBH group showed anxious and depressive-like behavior in the EPM and FST tests, as well as increased levels of RS and decreased GSH levels in the hippocampus. Quercetin treatment in the GBH+Quer group allowed partial or total improvement in behavioral tests (EPM and FST) and in the levels of oxidative stress markers (RS and GSH). However, the quercetin group showed similar behavior to the GBH group after treatment. The results revealed that oral exposure to a subchronic low dose of GBH was capable of promoting effects on behavior and oxidative stress in the hippocampus of mice. In addition, despite quercetin having a neuroprotective role, caution is needed when considering the possible per se effects of its continuous supplementation.",Alternative Hypotheses to the Adolescent Mental Illness Crisis A Collaborative Review

The first aim was to compare mental health status and online communication in 15-year-old Icelanders born in 1988 and in 1994. The second aim was to assess whether the relationship between online communication and mental health has changed among 15-year-old Icelanders from 2003 to 2015 across genders. Methods: Analysis used data from self-reports from 2003 ( N=385, 51% males) and 2015 ( N=302, 42% males). Mental health was assessed with subscales of Symptom Checklist 90 and online communications with self-reports. To evaluate the difference in anxiety and depression, a factorial analysis of variance was conducted between gender and years. Multigroup structural equation modelling was used to assess the change in the relationship between years. Results: Symptoms of anxiety and depression remained unchanged for males. Symptoms of depression increased for females, while anxiety was stable between 2003 and 2015. In 2003, there was no relationship between online communication and mental health. However, in 2015, an association was found for females. Conclusions: Depression is getting worse for adolescent females, and an association between time spent online communicating and mental health emerged for them in 2015, which did not exist in 2003.

We included data from 9,133,246 individuals aged 120 who contributed 117,682,651 person-years of observation time. Sex- and age-stratified annual incidence rates were estimated for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (age groups: 15, 69, 1012, 1316, 1719), depression, anxiety disorders (69, 1012, 1316, 1719), eating disorders and self-harm (1012, 1316, 1719) during 20032018. We fitted negative binomial regressions to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) to examine change in incidence between the first (2003) and final year (2018) year of observation and to examine sex-specific incidence.ResultsThe results indicated that the overall incidence has increased substantially in both boys and girls in between 2003 and 2018 for anxiety disorders (IRR 3.51 95% CI 3.183.89), depression (2.37; 2.032.77), ASD (2.36; 1.723.26), ADHD (2.3; 1.733.25), and self-harm (2.25; 1.822.79). The incidence for eating disorders also increased (IRR 1.3 95% CI 1.061.61), but less sharply. The incidence of anxiety disorders, depression, self-harm and eating disorders was in absolute terms higher in girls, whereas the opposite was true for the incidence of ADHD and ASD, which were higher among boys. The largest relative increases in incidence were observed for neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly among girls diagnosed with ADHD or ASD. However, in absolute terms, the incidence was much higher for depression and anxiety disorders.ConclusionThe number of young people seeking help for psychological distress appears to have increased in recent years. Changes to diagnostic criteria, reduced stigma, and increased awareness may partly explain our results, but we cannot rule out true increases in incidence occurring in the population. Whatever the explanation, the marked rise in demand for healthcare services means that it may be more challenging for affected young people to promptly access the care and support that they need.",Adolescent mood disorders since 2010

Multilevel models were used to assess the relative association between these measures, children's social media use and individual, household and community characteristics.High use of social media was found to be significantly associated with change in happiness scores but was not associated with worsening life satisfaction trajectories. The most consistent factor was gender, with girls experiencing the largest decline in happiness between two time points (0.18 points) and being more likely to have a worsening trajectory over time (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.36-2.32). Parental mental health, household support and household income were also important.Moderate use of social media does not play an important role in shaping children's life satisfaction. Higher levels of use is associated with lower levels of happiness, especially for girls but more research is needed to understand how this technology is being used.

This study therefore aims to analyse the influence that cybergossip and problematic Internet use have on cyberaggression and cybervictimisation, considering differences in age, gender, and the age at which the first smartphone was owned. 1013 adolescents between 12 and 18 years old (M = 14.0, SD = 1.42) (56.4% girls) from thirteen Spanish educational centres participated. The results, obtained through structural equation modelling, show that there is a high association between the four constructs, and explain a high variability of cyberaggression and cybervictimisation. It is relevant that cybergossip has a greater influence on the cyberaggression of girls, on subjects who are 1214 years old, and on victims aged 1518, while problematic Internet use has a greater influence on the cybervictimisation of boys and subjects who are 1214 years old. Furthermore, the fact of having had a smartphone before the age of 11 leads to a higher level of cyberaggression, explained by cybergossip and problematic Internet use. These results allow us to establish new channels of intervention.  Cyberbullying is associated with problematic Internet use (PIU) and cybergossip.  Cybergossip explains significantly cyberaggression of girls and 1214 subjects.  Cybervictimization from age 15 on is explained to a greater extent by cybergossip.

We examined the relationship between pornography use, subjective well-being, symptoms of depressions and anxiety, and self-esteem in two independent panel samples (N = 455; N = 858) of Croatian adolescents using cross-lagged path analysis and lagged linear mixed models. After controlling for impulsiveness and family environmentfactors that are unlikely to be influenced by pornography useearlier levels of pornography use were not significantly associated with subsequent decreases in subjective well-being across gender and panel. However, pornography use was associated with increases in both self-esteem and symptoms of depression and anxiety, albeit only among adolescent women in one of the two panels. In addition, low subjective well-being was associated with a subsequent increase in pornography use, but only in female adolescents in one panel. This studys results are not consistent with concerns about pornography use negatively contributing to male adolescents psychological well-being, but suggest potential antagonistic links between pornography use and specific facets of mental well-being in adolescent women.

This research used a qualitative approach to explore six parents' views on how their fear of risk might be shaping their children's play. The parents stated that their children were now more likely to take part in activities supervised by adults. The article shows that these findings may be linked to national trends and that occupational therapists should be concerned about the health implications of these changes.

The concerns about digital technologies negatively influencing sleep are therefore especially noteworthy, as sleep has been proven to greatly affect both cognitive and emotional well-being. The associations between digital engagement and adolescent sleep should therefore be carefully investigated in research adhering to the highest methodological standards. This understood, studies published to date have not often done so and have instead focused mainly on data derived from general retrospective self-report questionnaires. The value of this work has been called into question by recent research showing that retrospective questionnaires might fail to accurately measure these variables of interest. Novel and diverse approaches to measurement are therefore necessary for academic study to progress. Methods This study analyses data from 11,884 adolescents included in the UK Millennium Cohort Study to examine the association between digital engagement and adolescent sleep, comparing the relative effects of retrospective self-report vs. time-use diary measures of technology use. By doing so, it provides an empirical lens to understand the effects of digital engagement both throughout the day and before bedtime and adds nuance to a research area primarily relying on retrospective self-report. Results The study finds that there is a small negative association relating digital engagement to adolescent sleep both on weekdays and weekend days (median standardized association ?weekday = ?0.06 and ?weekend = ?0.03). There is a more negative association between digital engagement and total sleep time on weekdays compared to weekend days (median standardized ?weekday = ?0.08, median standardized ?weekend = ?0.02), while there is no such difference when examining adolescents bedtime. Surprisingly, and contrary to our expectations, digital technology use before bedtime is not substantively associated with the amount of sleep and the tardiness of bedtime in adolescents. Conclusions Results derived from the use of transparent Specification Curve Analysis methods show that the negative associations in evidence are mainly driven by retrospective technology use measures and measures of total time spent on digital devices during the day. The effects are overall very small: for example, an additional hour of digital screen time per day was only related to a 9 min decrease in total time spent sleeping on weekdays and a 3 min decrease on weekends. Using digital screens 30 min before bed led to a 1 min decrease in total time spent sleeping on weekdays and weekends. The study shows that more work should be done examining how to measure digital screen time before interventions are designed.",Social Media and Mental Health

In Part 1, women completed a series of questionnaires related to mental health outcomes and self-perceptions. Results showed that the frequency of Instagram use is correlated with depressive symptoms, self-esteem, general and physical appearance anxiety, and body dissatisfaction and that the relationship between Instagram use and each of these variables is mediated by social comparison orientation. In Part 2, participants were exposed to a range of either beauty, fitness, or travel Instagram images (or a control condition with no images). Beauty and fitness images significantly decreased self-rated attractiveness, and the magnitude of this decrease correlated with anxiety, depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and body dissatisfaction.

This paper aimed to investigate recent trends in mental ill health and health-related behaviours in two cohorts of UK adolescents in 2005 and 2015. Methods Prevalences in mental health (depressive symptoms, self-harm, anti-social behaviours, parent-reported difficulties) and health-related behaviours (substance use, weight, weight perception, sleep, sexual intercourse) were examined at age 14 in two UK birth cohorts; Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N=5627, born 199192) and Millennium Cohort Study (MCS, N=11318, born 200002). Prevalences and trend estimates are presented unadjusted and using propensity score matching and entropy balancing to account for differences between samples. Results Depressive symptoms (9% to 14.8%) and self-harm (11.8% to 14.4%) were higher in 2015 compared with 2005. Parent-reported emotional difficulties, conduct problems, hyperactivity and peer problems were higher in 2015 compared with 2005 (5.78.9% to 9.717.7%). Conversely, substance use (tried smoking, 9.2% to 2.9%; tried alcohol, 52.1% to 43.5%, cannabis, 4.6% to 3.9%), sexual activity (2% to 0.9%) and anti-social behaviours (6.240.1% to 1.627.7%) were less common or no different.

The findings should be interpreted bearing in mind limitations in ability to adequately harmonize certain variables and account for differences in attrition rates and generalizability of the two cohorts. Conclusions Given health-related behaviours are often cited as risk factors for poor mental health, our findings suggest relationships between these factors might be more complex and dynamic in nature than currently understood.

Before and after reading these articles, participants responded to questions from the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Analyses revealed that participants experienced alpha changes in anxiety after reading either article related to mass shootings, but not after reading the filler article. Furthermore, participants did not experience beta changes after reading any of the articles.

Currently there is insufficient experimental evidence about how extended video-game play may affect adolescents' sleep. The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term impact of adolescents' prolonged exposure to violent video-gaming on sleep. Seventeen male adolescents (mean age = 16  1 years) with no current sleep difficulties played a novel, fast-paced, violent video-game (50 or 150 min) before their usual bedtime on two different testing nights in a sleep laboratory. Objective (polysomnography-measured sleep and heart rate) and subjective (single-night sleep diary) measures were obtained to assess the arousing effects of prolonged gaming. Compared with regular gaming, prolonged gaming produced decreases in objective sleep efficiency (by 7  2%, falling below 85%) and total sleep time (by 27  12 min) that was contributed by a near-moderate reduction in rapid eye movement sleep (Cohen's d = 0.48). Subjective sleep-onset latency significantly increased by 17  8 min, and there was a moderate reduction in self-reported sleep quality after prolonged gaming (Cohen's d = 0.53). Heart rate did not differ significantly between video-gaming conditions during pre-sleep game-play or the sleep-onset phase. Results provide evidence that prolonged video-gaming may cause clinically significant disruption to adolescent sleep, even when sleep after video-gaming is initiated at normal bedtime. However, physiological arousal may not necessarily be the mechanism by which technology use affects sleep.",Video Game Use and Adolescent Health A Collaborative Review

Participants reported an average of 4.0 h of total screen time per day at baseline. At two-year-follow-up, 1.38% of the sample reported at least one suicidal behavior. Each additional hour of total screen time was prospectively associated with 1.09 higher odds of suicidal behaviors at 2-year-follow-up (95% CI 1.03-1.14), after adjusting for covariates.

I collect data on the causal chain of media effects: subscriptions to outlets, exposure to news on Facebook, visits to online news sites, and sharing of posts, as well as changes in political opinions and attitudes. Four main findings emerge. First, random variation in exposure to news on social media substantially affects the slant of news sites that individuals visit. Second, exposure to counter-attitudinal news decreases negative attitudes toward the opposing political party. Third, in contrast to the effect on attitudes, I find no evidence that the political leanings of news outlets affect political opinions. Fourth, Facebooks algorithm is less likely to supply individuals with posts from counter-attitudinal outlets, conditional on individuals subscribing to them.

School administrators face pressure to prepare for possible active shootings, and often do so through drills, which can range from general lockdowns to simulations, involving masked shooters and simulated gunfire, and many variations in between. However, the broad and lasting impact of these drills on the well-being of school communities is poorly understood. To that end, this article applies machine learning and interrupted time series analysis to 54 million social media posts, both pre- and post-drills in 114 schools spanning 33 states. Drill dates and locations were identified via a survey, then posts were captured by geo-location, school social media following, and/or school social media group membership. Results indicate that anxiety, stress, and depression increased by 3942% following the drills, but this was accompanied by increases in civic engagement (10106%). This research, paired with the lack of strong evidence that drills save lives, suggests that proactive school safety strategies may be both more effective, and less detrimental to mental health, than drills.",Alternative Hypotheses to the Adolescent Mental Illness Crisis A Collaborative Review

Methods   Individual-level data came from 154,981 adolescents (meanage= 13.5) from 29 countries that participated in the 2017/2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey. Intense SMU was measured by the time spent on social media, whereas problematic SMU was defined by symptoms of addiction to social media. Mental (life satisfaction and psychological complaints), school (school satisfaction and perceived school pressure), and social (family support and friend support) well-being were assessed. Country-level data came from aggregated individual-level data and data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on Internet access.       Results   Two-level regression analyses indicated that in countries with a lower prevalence of intense SMU, intense users reported lower levels of life satisfaction and family support and more psychological complaints than nonintense users. In contrast, in countries with a higher prevalence of intense SMU, intense users reported higher levels of family support and life satisfaction than nonintense users, and similar levels of psychological complaints. In all countries, intense users reported more friend support than nonintense users. The findings regarding problematic SMU were more consistent: In all countries, problematic users reported lower well-being on all domains than nonproblematic users. Observed differences in country-level prevalence rates of intense and problematic SMU could not be explained by mobile Internet access.       Conclusions   Adolescents reporting problematic SMU are particularly at risk of lower well-being.

Yet, little is known regarding the societal changes underlying secular trends in adolescent mental health. The educational stressors hypothesis states that educational expansion and a shift to knowledge economies makes life chances of adolescents more dependent on their educational performance, thus generating more school stress and, in turn, mental health problems. The present study tests this hypothesis using multilevel analyses and panel data techniques to analyse data from the Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey, including more than 150,000 adolescents in 33 European countries over 12 years. Results show that economic change, as measured by changes in national gross domestic product, but not educational expansion, contributes to more school stress in adolescents. Both economic change and educational expansion makes school stress more consequential for mental health problems, such that the effect of stress on mental health problems becomes stronger as countries grow richer and more educated. I conclude that, consistent with the educational stressors hypothesis, economic change and educational expansion has likely contributed to increasing mental health problems in adolescents.",Alternative Hypotheses to the Adolescent Mental Illness Crisis A Collaborative Review

This experiment fills a gap in the literature by manipulating lecture interest-value and controls for duration of FB exposure, time of interruption, FB material and the order of FB posts. One hundred and fifty participants were randomly allocated to one of six conditions: (A) no FB intrusions, high-interest (HI) lecture; (B) no FB intrusions, low-interest (LI) lecture (C) goal-relevant FB intrusions, HI lecture (D) goal-relevant FB intrusions, LI lecture (E) goal-irrelevant FB intrusions, HI lecture (F) goal-irrelevant FB intrusions, LI lecture. As predicted, participants were more susceptible to FB distractions when the primary learning task was of low-interest. The study also found that goal-relevant FB intrusions significantly reduced HI lecture comprehension compared to the control condition (A). The results highlight the need for recourses that will help educators increase student engagement with their learning task. Implications for future research are discussed.

Data were drawn from the School Children Mental Health Europe project conducted in six European Union countries (youth ages 611, n = 3195). Child mental health was assessed by parents and teachers using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and by children themselves with the Dominic Interactive. Child video game usage was reported by the parents. Teachers evaluated academic functioning. Multivariable logistic regressions were used. 20 % of the children played video games more than 5 h per week. Factors associated with time spent playing video games included being a boy, being older, and belonging to a medium size family. Having a less educated, single, inactive, or psychologically distressed mother decreased time spent playing video games. Children living in Western European countries were significantly less likely to have high video game usage (9.66 vs 20.49 %) though this was not homogenous. Once adjusted for child age and gender, number of children, mothers age, marital status, education, employment status, psychological distress, and region, high usage was associated with 1.75 times the odds of high intellectual functioning (95 % CI 1.312.33), and 1.88 times the odds of high overall school competence (95 % CI 1.442.47).

However, it is often very difficult to execute experimental research on actual social media platforms, or to link survey responses to online behavior in order to perform correlational analyses. Thus, there is a natural desire to use self-reported behavioral intentions in standard survey studies to gain insight into online behavior. But are such hypothetical responses hopelessly disconnected from actual sharing decisions? Or are online survey samples via sources such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) so different from the average social media user that the survey responses of one group give little insight into the on-platform behavior of the other? Here we investigate these issues by examining 67 pieces of political news content. We evaluate whether there is a meaningful relationship between (i) the level of sharing (tweets and retweets) of a given piece of content on Twitter, and (ii) the extent to which individuals (total N = 993) in online surveys on MTurk reported being willing to share that same piece of content. We found that the same news headlines that were more likely to be hypothetically shared on MTurk were also shared more frequently by Twitter users, r = .44. For example, across the observed range of MTurk sharing fractions, a 20 percentage point increase in the fraction of MTurk participants who reported being willing to share a news headline on social media was associated with 10x as many actual shares on Twitter. We also found that the correlation between sharing and various features of the headline was similar using both MTurk and Twitter data.

Following exclusion criteria, 31 papers could be classified as adolescent pornography studies including research on the prevalence, effects and risk factors for pornography. Most of the studies have been conducted in other countries where the prevalence of adolescent pornography has ranged from 8%-22% for habitual use. The effects of pornography have included legal problems, permissive attitudes and unrealistic expectations regarding sex as well as problematic behaviors including victimization and assault. The predictor or risk variables have included male gender, family dysfunction and sensation-seeking. Like other literature on adolescent problems, this research is limited by primarily deriving from selfreport and parent report and by the absence of longitudinal data that might inform whether the data being reported are effects of or risk factors for adolescent pornography and the need for prevention/intervention research.",Porn Use and Adolescent Health A Collaborative Review

Our results support recent findings that more fake news is shared by older users and conservatives and that both viewing and sharing patterns suggest a preference for ideologically congenial misinformation. We also find that fake news articles related to politics are more popular among older Americans than other types, while the youngest users share relatively more articles with clickbait headlines.

Drawing on research examining the use of big data in social science and reception studies, we identify six misconceptions about misinformation and highlight the conceptual and methodological challenges they raise. The first set of misconceptions concerns the prevalence and circulation of misinformation. First, scientists focus on social media because it is methodologically convenient, but misinformation is not just a social media problem. Second, the internet is not rife with misinformation or news, but with memes and entertaining content. Third, falsehoods do not spread faster than the truth; how we define (mis)information influences our results and their practical implications. The second set of misconceptions concerns the impact and the reception of misinformation. Fourth, people do not believe everything they see on the internet: the sheer volume of engagement should not be conflated with belief. Fifth, people are more likely to be uninformed than misinformed; surveys overestimate misperceptions and say little about the causal influence of misinformation. Sixth, the influence of misinformation on peoples behavior is overblown as misinformation often preaches to the choir.

Objectives To provide estimates of obesity and extreme obesity prevalence for children and adolescents for 2011-2014 and investigate trends by age between 1988-1994 and 2013-2014. Design, Setting, and Participants Children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years with measured weight and height in the 1988-1994 through 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Exposures Survey period. Main Outcomes and Measures Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) at or above the sex-specific 95th percentile on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) BMI-for-age growth charts. Extreme obesity was defined as a BMI at or above 120% of the sex-specific 95th percentile on the CDC BMI-for-age growth charts. Detailed estimates are presented for 2011-2014. The analyses of linear and quadratic trends in prevalence were conducted using 9 survey periods. Trend analyses between 2005-2006 and 2013-2014 also were conducted. Results Measurements from 40 780 children and adolescents (mean age, 11.0 years; 48.8% female) between 1988-1994 and 2013-2014 were analyzed. Among children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years, the prevalence of obesity in 2011-2014 was 17.0% (95% CI, 15.5%-18.6%) and extreme obesity was 5.8% (95% CI, 4.9%-6.8%). Among children aged 2 to 5 years, obesity increased from 7.2% (95% CI, 5.8%-8.8%) in 1988-1994 to 13.9% (95% CI, 10.7%-17.7%) (<i>P</i> &lt; .001) in 2003-2004 and then decreased to 9.4% (95% CI, 6.8%-12.6%) (<i>P</i> = .03) in 2013-2014.

Following the self-presentational theory, the study explores a key component of the Internet paradoxwhether Facebook suppresses or enhances users' interpersonal competence (specifically empathic social skills), given their respective personality makeup. Going further, the study assesses these events' subsequent impacts on users' psychological well-being. Analogous to a double-edged sword, Facebook activities are hypothesized to suppress the positive effect of a user's extraversion orientation on empathic social skills but lessen the negative effect of neuroticism on these skills. The study examines a sample of college-aged Facebook users (n=515), who responded to a large-scale online survey. The findings from a structural equation modeling analysis indicate that while empathic social skills are positively associated with life satisfaction, Facebook activities mainly exert suppression effects. Only upon low usage can Facebook activities lessen the negative effect of neuroticism on empathic social skills, suggesting that Facebook may appear as a less threatening platform for social interactions among neurotics. Yet, results in general suggest that undesirable effects may occur at high levels of Facebook usage whereby both extroverted and neurotic users displace real world social ties to online ones.

Our analysis suggests that suspended accounts were overwhelmingly human operated and no more likely than other accounts to share fake news. This study sheds light on the moderation policies of social media platforms, which have increasingly raised contentious debates, and equally importantly on the integrity and dynamics of political discussion on social media during major political events.",Social Media and Political Dysfunction

This study suggests that fears of selective exposure, selective avoidance, and polarization infecting the democratic process appear overstated. First, polarization was positively related to confidence in Congress and the president. Second, selective exposure to social media sites strengthens confidence in the president and in Congress. Twitter boosts confidence in Congress. Third, selective avoidance had a negative influence on other measures, which suggests people seek both information that challenges their views as well as ones that supports them. Finally, selective exposure and avoidance proved weak indicators of polarization.

These rates were analyzed to describe simultaneously the changes affecting successive birth cohorts and the changes associated with the period in which the onset of the disorder occurred, using age-period-cohort (APC) models. The non-identifiability problem inherent in all APC models was resolved by assuming that the linear period effect and linear cohort effect were non-negative. This assumption is consistent with our a priori substantive knowledge of the disease. Under this assumption, as the linear period effect varies from its minimum to its maximum values, a family of curves representing the possible effects of a factor was generated for each of the time factorsage, period and cohort. The results of the analysis showed a sharp increase in rates of major depression among both men and women in the birth cohort born during the years 19351945. The rates among females, however, seemed to have stabilized in the generations born since 1945, while the rates in males continued to rise sharply among the cohorts born in the following decade, after which, in 1955, they also levelled off. In contrast, the rates associated with period of onset of major depression continued to increase between the years 19601980 among both men and women of all ages studied. These findings are considered in light of the persistent concentration of depression in women and in biologically related members of families of affected individuals.

            sistematic review of experimental evidences","The public opinion is ever more interested and worried about possible effects of exposure to VGs (video games) on human life and well-being. Scientific literature shows several evidences highlighting negative outcomes on behavioural, emotive, cognitive and physical health spheres. All these aspects are intrinsically linked to sleep quality and quantity and to date very few studies directly investigated the effects of videogame (VG) exposure on sleep and post-sleep cognitive status. The aim of the present systematic review is to examine the impact that the exposure to VGs can produce on sleep pattern and the consequent post-sleep cognitive abilities. To this extent, only studies directly investigating the effects of VGs on sleep features and post-sleep cognitive abilities have been selected and discussed. Data currently present in literature show the alteration of sleep pattern after exposure to VGs. The analysis indicated a reduction of Total Sleep Time (TST) and an increase of Sleep Onset Latency (SOL), modifications of the REM sleep and Slow Wave Sleep (SWS), and increased sleepiness and self-perceived fatigue. Moreover, post-sleep sustained attention and verbal memory also appear to be impaired. It can be concluded that playing VGs for long periods, particularly in the evening, is a significant, common and probable cause of sleep problems: evening exposure to VGs, in fact, can bring to insufficient and low quality sleep, with possible effects on cognition in the subsequent waking days. Potential methodological flaws and limitations of these studies have also been described and discussed. Because of the very limited number of available study on this topic further research is strongly needed.",Video Game Use and Adolescent Health A Collaborative Review
